# Description
This is data given to be my Sarah Towne[^1]. I've signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with her which can be found in the data folder. Sarah's description of the data is as follows

> Here's a quick explanation -- I looked across all vessels at two levels: 

> 1) Identical ownership members (tab 1 - vessel accounts exact): If more than one vessel was owned by the exact same members, it was given an ID. For example, even though the vessel owner at the top level appears to be different for most of these vessels, at the bottom level ownership, these vessels are all owned by the exact same group: CALAMARI, COHO, GRUMPY J, JO MARIE, MISS PACIFIC, PACIFIC CONQUEST, PACIFIC FUTURE, PACIFIC HOOKER, PRIVATEER, SEA PRINCESS, SWELL RIDER, TRIPLE STAR. 

> 2) One or more members are the same (tab 2 - vessel accounts 1 common): This sheet is a bit more complex because I had to add more columns. Here, if more than one vessel had a similar member, they were given the same ID. For example, if I owned vessel A by myself, vessel B with you, and vessel C with Steve, my ID would show up on all three vessels. If you look at Traveler, you'll see that Traveler has one or more similar members with (4) ARCTIC FURY, NEAHKAHNIE, NORDIC FURY, PACIFIC FURY, SEA STORM; (22) MAR-GUN; and (24) MARK I.

> Also, I'm not sure how you're looking at catch data and VMS data but this might complicate things. I work off of vessel accounts (I included the vessel account numbers -- please keep this confidential, it's like a checking account number and is the number vessel owners give to the processor so that the landings come out of their vessel account). Whenever the owner of a vessel changes, they have to get a new vessel account. Okay I'm heading home for the night but give me a call any afternoon if you want to go over this!

> PS. The numbers on sheets 1 and 2 do not correspond at all. I just went numerically starting at 1 and did these sheets separately!
