# Guide to data 
All [original data here](http://www.pcouncil.org/habitat-and-communities/area-closures/)

`GCA_nonRCA.kmz` displays Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) in the Southern California Bight and Essential Fish Habitat conservation areas as polygons.

`Nontrawl RCA (all year 2013-14).kmz` displays the nontrawl RCA, which has the same configuration year round.

`RCA waypoints 2013-14.kmz` displays boundary lines used to construct RCAs in use in 2013-14, based on coordinates published in Federal regulations.  The 150-fm and 200-fm lin    es were revised to better reflect actual depth contours.  A new line is included, which modifies the 150-fm line north of Cape Mendocino to include “petrale cutouts.”

`RCA_Latitude_Boundaries.kmz` represents the latitudes at which RCA boundaries may change from the approximation of one depth contour to another.

`Trawl RCA Period 4 (Jul-Aug) 2012.kmz` displays the trawl RCA boundaries (as lines and points) for July-August 2012.

`Trawl RCA Period 5 (Sep-Oct) 2012.kmz` displays the trawl RCA boundaries (as lines and points) for September-October 2012.

`Trawl RCA Period 6 (Nov-Dec) 2012.kmz` displays the trawl RCA boundaries (as lines and points) for November-December 2012.

`Trawl RCA Period 1 (Jan-Feb) 2013.kmz` displays the trawl RCA boundaries (as lines and points) for January-February 2013.

`Trawl RCA Period 2 (Mar-Apr) 2013.kmz` displays the trawl RCA boundaries (as lines and points) for March April 2013.

`West_Coast_EEZ.kmz` displays an approximation of the boundary of the west coast Exclusive Economic Zone.
