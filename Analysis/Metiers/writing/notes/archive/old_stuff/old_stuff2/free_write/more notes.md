Definitions of fisheries

Wilen 1979:

+ Effort is a multidimensional concept, and very difficult to define. Has been treated abstractly in traditional fisheries models, has allowed most economists to ignore it, assume that it can be both quantified and managed. 
+ Thus it's of the utmost importance to understand how this multidimensional concept of effort (i.e. vessel length/tonnage, days at sea, number of vessels, gear, area searched) responds to changes in restrictions on any number of effort dimensions.

But these days most discussions of effort focus on effective fishing pressure, which is a function of number of trips, type of gear, type of vessel (tonnage, hp, etc), skipper behavior (search strategy), etc.  

From an ecological perspective, fishing mortality is the relevant metric. This is a function of the number of trips, type of gear, type of vessel (tonnage, hp, etc), skipper behavior (search strategy), etc. Historically, building this functions have been largely ignored. But to begin to include humans in ecosystem models, we need to figure out a way to do so. Further, if fisheries are to be modeling as a social-ecological system, understanding how the multidimensional concept of effort translates into ecological forces (i.e. predation) is required. 

I attempt to quantitatively define fisheries on the US west coast based on catch composition. Using these definitions, it becomes straightforward to quantify the multidimensional effort of these fisheries (i.e. spatial, temporal distribution) along with the composition of these fleets (made up of specialists, generalists?)




Ecological, economic and social dynamics all control ecosystems in which humans play a large part. Social ecological systems (SES) modeling strives to bring all three discplines together to more fully capture the dynamics of these systems. This is challenging, because most of the ways humans are linked to natural systems are indirect, diffuse and hard to quantify. This is the common complaint to an ecosystem services-type approach. Ecosystem processes such as water filtration, carbon sequestration and temperature regulation are hard to quantify as a function of the species present in the ecosystem, and tough to predict how people will respond to changes in such services and affect the ecological system. i.e. there is a need for more explicit modeling (and understanding) of feedbacks betwen social and ecological systems. 

Fisheries, as a provisioning service (in the MA sense), is an appealingly straightforward case study. Fishermen have a clear ecological impact as a marine predator, causing mortality in fish populations. As such, fishermen responds to ecological conditions: fish range shifts (Pinsky), collapses in population abundance (cod collapse spatial change). At the same time a fishing vessel is obviusly an economic entity, a firm, subject to market forces of supply and demand (e.g. price of fish, price of fuel). Finally a fishermen, being a person, is a social entity, affected by cultural norms and societal context of which s/he is a part. 

Starting from an ecological perspective, we can build a predator prey system, in which the fish are the prey and fishermen are predators. But in a predator-prey system there is a definition of a "species" and/or age/stage classes. This is a required simplification of the heterogeneity often present in populations in ecological systems. To adapt an ecological predator-prey model to a fishery, we require these species. Prey species are relatively straight forward: they can be species and/or stocks. However the predators are harder. 

Fishermen are also heterogeneous. Individuals can be differentiated by the type of vessels (length, tonnage, horsepower), type of gear, species targeted, seasonal and/or spatial distribution. Commonly the predator unit is assumed to be a "fishery": a group of fishermen who use similar gear and harvest the same (group of) species. However individuals can switch in and out of a fishery, and birth-death processes don't retain the same significance as in an ecological system. Instead taking on an entry-exit meaning. Further, if fishery is assumed to be the unit of analysis, management can be targeted to encourage the maintenance of a particular fishery, at expense of the particular people that make it up. Some understanding of -who_ is doing the fishery is clearly important. Finally, to even understand fisheries as entities whose dynamics can be modeled, one must understand the dynamics that control their grown and decline, i.e. entry exit decisions made by the fishermen.
