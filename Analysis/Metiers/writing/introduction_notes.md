 # Conceptual notes

## Why do a metier analysis?

# Motivation (conservation)

+ Stakeholder wellbeing is an increasingly important measure of conservation success (i.e. ecosystem services, etc.) and is a formal one for US fisheries ("fishing community health")
+ We examine income variability as a measure of human wellbeing.
+ Natural resource-based livlihoods (fisheries, farming, etc.
) can experience income variability for any of three reasons: environmental (vagaries of weather, disease, abundance of resource), economic (market access, demand, price), or management (restricted access).
+ Previous work shows that diversity of fisheries participation is negatively related to income variability and suggests that geography and management may play large roles in determining how diverse income is.
+ We add to this literature by replicating diversity-income variability relationship, unpack the proxy variable of geography and explicitly test to what extent ecology, markets and management can explain this trend in income variability. 

+ more ecologically based approach for multispecies fisheries (why?)
    + multispecies fisheries comprise multiple trophic levels and competition. It's hard to regulate on a species-by-species basis when the fishing gear is unselective
    + Lucey & Fogarty want to find groups of fishermen that are using the same gear to catch the same mix of species adn compare it to  ecological production units from an EBM proposed plan.
+  When you use permits, you assume that the permit structure is representative of the fishing pressure. But there's no guaurntee that this is the case. Fisheries management has long been plagued my a mis-match of scales between ecological managment scales (i.e. multiple stocks considered a single stock, etc). This problem is particularly accute with unselective gear. Murawski et al 1983 and Lucey & Fogarty 2013 both identify this as a problem for the NE where groundfish trawlers are really targeting at least 8 distinct assemblages of fish. A metier analysis, therefore, provides a check of the assumption that permitting structure represents operational fisheries.
+ Especially important to check this assumption as interest in EBM grows. Determining how the ecological and social drivers interact to result in operational fisheries.
+ When analyzing fishing fleets, the goal is to be analyzing a group of vessels within similar catch and identical gears.

+ Jonas gives no justification for why he uses metier-like analyses and not permit data.

## What do we want to know?


## Human wellbeing
+ human wellbeing has become an important concept and metric context with the rise of ecosystem services
+ many ways to define such a vague concept
+ as we seek to manage social-ecological systems, we need ways of measuring the condition of the ecosystem (including the people)
+ management and policy can affect human wellbeing in two ways, indirectly through managing the resource, or directly by mediating access to the resource. Most effort is focused on the latter.
+ For example, recent work has suggested that whe managers limit entry to some fisheries, vessels are unable to diversify across fisheries, and as a result are exposed to greater risk via income volatility.
+ A common example of the former is the commercial value of species in these ecosystems, assumed to map in some way to "human wellbeing".
+ However commercial value of species are just one way to measure the benefits that people receive from harvested species. The variability of income is another.

+ Holland uses fisheries diversity as an indicator of financial risk for the fishing industry. We are interested in exploring what predicts fishing diversity to figure out which segments of the fleet are most resilient or vulnerable. And what management can do to help the vulnerable populations.

Fishing diversity is a general characteristic of a vessel, but it may be possible to understand what promotes or limits fishing diversity. Certainly as more fisheries become limited entry, the lack of permits is an obvious drop. But local geography and condition of the ecosystem can also prevent diversity: if the species don't exist in a particular place, they can't be fished. Market's are another limitor, if you can't sell the fish, there's no point in fishing for it. Finally, diversity is important if we assume the fisheries are highly variable and asynchronous. The variability and asynchronoy is often due to the ecology of the species (i.e. tuna and whiting don't show up really until the summer). Or the variability can be management (changing catch limits year to year). Regardless, there may be species with low-variability life-histories and management. Thus particiupating in those fisheries would reduce the need to participate in many fisheries. Finally, it may be that diversifying across fisheries is mainly a monetary barrier, so captial is important.
+ We test whether fishing diversity's reduction in income volatility depends on the particular fishing strategy a vessel uses, ecology and management.
+ We restrict our analyses to vessels that land at a single port. These vessels are likely to be more vulnerable than vessels that can move fluidly from port to port.

## Questions

+ Does the amount which diversification reduces income volatility depend on the identity of fishing strategy the vessel employs?
+ Can ecological and economic access explain patterns in diversity?
+ Does income limit ability to diversify: ie only vessels with a lot of money can afford to diversify across fisheries?



Previous work has identified that diversification across fisheries is an indicator of how much financial risk to which a vessel is exposed. The more diversified a vessel is, the lower income variability they have, on average. Why? Work in Alaska has suggested that local geography might be a contributing factor (Sethi et al. 2014?) or limited entry management (Kasperski & Holland 2013), but to my knowledge no work has empirically examined what predicts a vesselâ€™s diversification across fisheries.

Fisheries diversity could be a product of a number of social and/or ecological drivers. Limited entry management is plausible, but so are ecological drivers (are species abundant enough to be fished?, habitat availability - distance to rockfish habitat or deep water) and/or economic constraints (market availability - is there a place to sell the fish?), and capital (can you afford to buy the additional gear?).

An important detail is that diversity is important if we assume the fisheries yields are highly variable and asynchronous. The variability and asynchrony is often due to the ecology of the species (i.e. tuna and whiting don't show up on the US west coast really until the summer). Or the variability can be management (changing catch limits year to year, salmon?). Regardless, there may be species with low-variability life-histories and management. Targeting these species may negate the need for diversification, and allow vessels to specialize. Thus before we devote attention to how to predict diversification, we seek to understand whether diversification's effect on income volatility depends on the fisheries in which a vessel participates.



[test whether interactions between strategies and diversity]

+ So what can managers and policy makers do to improve a vessel's ability to diversify across fisheries? There are some things that can't be changed, like geography. If the distance to deep water is a contributing factor, managers can't do much. But there are many more potential drivers that could be: abundance of a species, would suggest a human well-being argument for improvement stock status. If making market access is important, improving infrastructure, or encouraging more processors to be at a certain port could be targeted measures. Finally, if drivers are found to be impossible to change, quantifying the predictors of diversity will help identify vulnerable communities, and if nothing else, can highlight the need to develop non-fisheries livelihoods.

A

To determine whether the identify of fisheries changes the effect of diversity, we categorize each vessels participation based on a multi-step classification process. First we categorize each trip landed into a particular fishery. And then look for characteristic combinations of fisheries participation in a year.

+ why don't we just do this based on the total amount of target species? Do I need to compare outcomes to when I just do it the Dan Holland way? Does our way keep together important ecological structure? i.e. rockfish? Sablefish might be a good argument. Sablefish is caught either with trawl or fixed gear. ..but strategy would remain the same.. We see other fisheries right? Hagfish? sea cucumbers? Spiny lobsters and rock crab? Benefit of letting the data do the talking.
