Characterize this variability over two decades and identify associations between community attributes and revenues variability

Collate community indices such as population, fishing opportunities (total number of permits held by a community), fishermen experience, size and diversity of fishing portfolio, community demographics. 

Measure revenue variability by coefficinet of variation (CV) and conditional value at risk (CVaR). 

Find that communities fishing portfolio size (number of active fisheries) and diversification of revenue are related to lower fishing revenues variability.  Especially after controlling for location, population size, and fleet investments.

Size and diversification of fishing portfolios is related to the number of local fisheries. 

Suggest that the fishing variability may be "predetermined" by location, and that other avenues of diversification in non-fisheries income should be explored

+ Use catch data from US west coast and Alaska
+ Measure income diversity for individual vessels using Simpson diversity index
+ Find that vessel grouped by length, average revenue and participation in specific fisheries have distinct trends in diversity over time. But that if you group all vessels together has no distinct trend. But if you look at just vessels that were present at the beginning and end of the dataset, those vessels get significantly less diverse over time. But are also still more diversified than the fleet as a whole in 2010. Those vessels that have entered more recently are less diversified and remain so. 
+ The more money you make, the more likely you are to be diversified. Also the bigger the boat, the more diversified you are. 
+ Look at income diversity trends over time, find that vessels are the least diverse they've been in 30 years

+ Find a dome shaped relationship between income variability and income diversification. 

+ Suggest that management has reduced access to fisheries, which would then limit a fishermen's ability to diversify income risk across multiple fisheries}
