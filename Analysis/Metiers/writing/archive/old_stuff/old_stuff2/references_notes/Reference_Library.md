## @Smith1974: Fishing success in a regulated commons (1974)
 tags: ["Empirical", "Data", "fishing"]

  + Find that in Oregon from 1963-1971 fishing success declined but fihsers wiere inconclusve regarding the need for intervention. This because those that were significantly affected by the declining fishing success (fisher per fisher) quietly adapted by leaving the fishery. This left a discrepency between declining success and perceptiosn of it by fishers. 
  + Searches for evidence of a tragedy of the commons by looking at how fishing success changed over time. 
  + Interviewed 150 commercial fishermen from Oregon, mostly salmon trollers with the goal to get their views on fishing success and to see if they though the number of commercial fishermen should be limited. 
  + Responses typically referenced one of three themes: competition between fishermen, a diversity of fishing success among fishermen and the wider relationships between commercial fishermen and other harvesters of the fisheries resources. Also responses described how fishing success operated on individuals or small groups and seldom gained broad attention, how declining fishing success affected each fishermen differently depending on his reason for fishing and how declining fishing success was related to broader social and politcial issues. 
  + Fishermen generally wanted to exclude competitors: commercial wanted to exclude recreational (and vice versa), area specialists wanted to exclude new-comers and newcomers labelled these fishermen as "homegrounders" and accussed them of not being able to fish and locking up the resources for themselves. 
  + Found evidence of the establishment of territories, formation of fishermen's organizations, and closed code-groups and avoidance of newcomers.
  + Found evidence of highliners (in 1971 12% of the fleet landed 50% of the total salmon harvested). So average decline in fishing success didn't mean very much to fishermen. Also highliners were defined within cliques, not absolute. 
  + Also fishermen that were unsuccessful quit and found other employment, and many fishers took this to be an adequate mechanism to regulate the number of fishermen competing for access to a fishery. 
  + Also declining catch sometimes was masked by increases in price. In 1972 price nearly doubled for coho salmon. 
  + Fishermen valued fishing beyond economic incentives: it was subsidized recreation, a chance to be one's own boss, to keep busy in retirement, a form of relaxation, etc. People varied on which of these aspects were important and which aspects were the most important. If fishermen fished because it had significant non-monetary value and had an alternate form of income, these would be subsidized to continue fishing. 
  + Fishermen also felt like they were not listened-to or needs-respected in the policy process and felt like they had very little say compared to the other resource-users/competitors in the system. 

## @McCay1978: Systems ecology, people ecology, and the anthropology of fishing communities (1978)
 tags: ["Empirical", "fishing", "Sociological"]
 cited from: [@Millington1984]

 - Most anthropological studies of fishing communities use environmetnal variables and their differences in time and space to help explain selected features of fishing lifestyles. 
 - Critically reviews "systems ecology" approaches in fishing community studies, advocates an alternative "people ecology" using data and research among commercial fishermen of northeastern Newfoundland. 
 - Systems ecology incorporates the natural environment and typically focuses on populations and systmes, rather than on communities, cultures or individuals as units of analysis. This approach has some promise in helping us understand how fishermen manage their relations to marine reosurces. . 
 - Early economic work characterizes fishermen as the 'bad guys' who lack any self restraint and thus perpetuate the tragedy of the commons. Yet there are examples of formal or informal property rights to prime fishing space, modes of excluding newcomers or outsiders from "community" waters and information-managemetn tactics which help establish temporary property rights to concentrations of fish. Most of these traits hinge on the management of fishing space rather than of fishing effort and fish populations per se. 
 - Also argues that equilibria are often referenced (management will restore equilibrium" of an ecological system upset by technological change) but rarely define what an equilibrium would entail or prove that one ever existed.
 - Systems ecology may lead us to ascribe causation between behavior and environmental feedbacks. For example in understanding the effects of territoriality and other behaviors among fishermen to reduce competition for a limited resource and lower levels of fish mortality, we might interpret cultural traits as being derived from, dependent on, or maintained by their ecological functions. Which may lead us to ignore important dimensions of social structure and to make untenable assertions about the relations between people and their resources. 
 - Also examples where secrecy of fishing spots seemed to function to prevent overfishing, but when a social condition changed (gear became aggregated in one person's control), secrecy vanished and species were overfished. So it wasn't dependent on the environment, but on the social structure. 
 - Rather than look for, hypothesize the existence of a self-regulating system involving human populations and their environments it is better to focus on problems and hazards faced by people and how they might respond to them. This leaves open the question of whether individuals, organizations, groups, populations or ecosystems are the significant units of adaptiation. ANd it may vary, perhaps predictably, with the nature of the environmental problem. 
 - One suggested approach is 'adaptive strategy': the many seperate adjustments that people devise in order to obtain resources and to solve the immediate problems confronting them. Most relevant to fishing are the ways that people adapt and cope with environmental change and uncertainty. Family firms and composite fishing strategies may be viewed as adaptive strategies which help maintain resilience in the face of fluctuating, uncertain or declining fisheries. 
 - Describes Newfoundland cod fishery that was very adaptable and had many different types of gears and habitats in which to target code (inshore, deep water) along with alternative fish to supplement (salmon adn lobster). Additionally many fishers had alternate jobs and/or sources of income. Finally the system of exchange between fishermen and the merchant houses helped minimze the efect of annual fluctuations. Merchants forwarded annual expesnes of outfitting and household consumption against the season's catch and carried fishermen's debts from one year to the next. The system, like sharecropping, represents a mode of risk minimization in a setting in which labor is plentiful and capital scarce. 
 - Details two kinds of adaptive strategies: diversification and intensification. Diversification is the general "spreading of the risk", and to expanding alternative modes of coping with environmetnal problems. Intensification refers to increased commitment to an investmetn in one or another mode of resource procurement. The two strategies may be temporally or logically related in a process of response: diversification as an adaptive strategy comes first, and intensification follows. The logic is that of the "economics of flexibility". According to the theory, minimal, less costly and reversible responses to environmental perturbation are predicted to occur. If the environmental problem worsens, or is not adequately met by the inital responses, "deeper", or more costly, and less reversible responses take over, restoring flexibiltity to other resposnes. 
 - Thus in Newfoundland, the initial response to fishery declines, as well as in the price of fish, was the normal response to environmental uncertainty: the expansion of alternatives (diversification). Some parts of the island shifted to lobster and crab fishing and many adult men found jobs in construction and mining sectors of the regional economy or moved to Toronto and Montreal. Thus the total participation in the fishing industry remained approximately constant. However  

## @HilbornLedbetter1979: Analysis of the British Columbia salmon purse-seine fleet: dynamics of movement (1979)
 tags:["Empirical", "Individual Variation", "fishing"]

 - Looks at Salmon purse-seiners in BC. 
 - Uses fish-ticket data and examines how landed value per weeks fishing (CPUE) varies by fisherman and location. 
 - BC coastline is broken into 29 areas by the fisheries service. These 29 areas have been combined into 8 larger aggregates
 - Data from 1973-1976
 - Management is: Daily openings of each statistical area. Generally the fishery will open on Sunday at 1800 and run for 24-h or 12-h increments depending on the intensity fo fishing effort and the strength of the salmon run. The fishery is usually open between 2 and 4 days.
 - Length provides enough time for boats to move between areas between openings but potentially penalizes boast which more between areas during an opening. 
 - Regard the basic unit of fishing opportunity as 1 week. Assume that fishermen must decide where they want to fish during the next week and allow sufficient time to be in that position on Sunday afternoon.
 - Seine fishing starts in May and can last through November in some areas. 
 - Assign vessels to two categories: stationary boats which fish only in one of the 8 aggregate areas and mobile boats which fish in more than one aggregate area. 
 - Most vessels move (ratio is 5:1 in 1973 and 12:1 in 1976). 
 - Clear that if you want to predict effort in a particular area, need to understand drivers of movement. 
 - Find that mobile boats there is a linear relationship between CPUE in a statistical area and effort in the subsequent week. 
 - For stationary boats find that only a subset of boats fish to a certain success rate (~$1000/wk) and then all stationary boats in that area will fish. 
 - However the absolute value at which boats will move areas/join fishery varies. In good years boats may not join for $3000/week but in poor years all boats may join for that amount. 
 - Stationary boat response implies marginal costs (expenses of fishing or alternative opportunities) that prevent all boats from operating until certain CPUE levels are reached. 
 - Hypothesize the following: Traditional patterns: fishermen fish in traditional patterns and the best prediction of efforts for an area will be the historical effort in that area; Coast-Wide Equalization: fishermen will move from area to area to average out CPUE; Area-Specific Desirability: each area has its own costs and desirability and fishermen will move between areas maintaining the ratios of CPUE in the different areas. 
 - Predictions are: Traditional patterns: fishermen will not respond to changes in CPUE; Coast-wide equalization; CPUE will remain constant; Area-specific desirability: fishermen will move to maintain ratios of CPUE in different areas. 
 - Assume that the value landed per boat week in a given area and in a given year is determined by the provincial average, can construct a 2-way ANOVA where one effect is the year and the other effect is the area. 
 - Find P < 0.001 difference between areas and year, shows that areas are different. And find that the ratio of landed value per boat week in each aggregate area to the provincial average in the major fishing areas remains approximately constant. 
 - Strict economic hypothesis which allows for different operating costs in each area would suggest that boats should move into areas of ‘excess’ profits until the profit per boat in each area is the same. Don’t have data on the differences in operating costs between areas and so cannot test this hypothesis directly. But even so, find areas that should have no real reason to be different in costs, one has a consistently lower CPUE. Thus assume that the differences between areas are due to some combination of economics and relative non-economic desirabilities. Also this work doesn’t require all boats to be mobile, only a sufficient segment and that the mobile segment will take advantage of temporarily high catch areas. 
 - Also seems to imply some amount of information transfer between boats. Also I wonder if there are any differences between the mobile and stationary segments of fishermen. Think that you could make a foraging model to show when it’s better to be a patch specializer versus a patch generalist (i.e. mobile). 

## @Peterman1980: Dynamics of native Indian food fisheries on Salmon in British Columbia (1980)
 tags: ["Empirical", "Fishing", "Pred-Prey"]

 + Empirical fits a functional response to Native American salmon food fisheries in BC. 
 + Concerned in particular whether human caused mortality is likely to be compensatory or depensatory. Depensatory would mean increasing mortality at low density of fish. 
 + Used data between 1947-1976 to look at annual escapements, catches and permits. 
 + Effort is measured as the number of permits issued each year.
 + During the time of this analysis the major management approach was area closures to obtain sufficient escapements. 
 + Total fish available are equal to the sum of escapements plus catch. 
 + To find functional response, regressed effort on abundance of the previous year to determine if there was an aggregation response from fishermen. 
 + Found there was no numerical response in these fisheries. Found that in the fisheries studied there is no tendency to change effort when amount of fish changes at harvesting locations: effort is independent of fish abundance. However the number of permits assumes everyone spends the same amount of time fishing and only the head of a household receives a permit. Thus it doesn't account for more/less people in a household fishing. 
 + Found type II functional response best fit data by plotting percent of population taken by fishermen against total abundance. 

## @McCay1980: A fishermen's cooperative, limited: indigenous resource managemetn in a complex society (1980)
 tags: ["Empirical", "Fishing", "Sociological"]

 + Description of a fishermen's cooperative in the New York Bight. Emphasizes the ways that this cooperative is a part of indigineous fisheries management as a part of its larger function to help members cope with environmental uncertainty
 + Membership in the cooperative gives fishers access to dock to unload catch, sell their fish through the cooperative and share in profits of the cooperative through annual patronage refunds when available. They often recieve a higher price and stronger markets for fish due to the skill of their business manager.
 + These fishermen fish for whiting
 + One major fishing ground: a submarine canyone wihtin 10-20 nautical miles from the cooperative's port. 
 + Fish often were scattered when large numbers of trawlers were on the grounds. 
 + This study was conducted as the EEZs were being established and foregin fleets pushed out. 
 + Compete with fishers from other ports
 + Demand for whiting is relatively elastic at the retail level, so demand at the dockside on any given day is inelastic. (Don't understand this). Instead sounds like demand is inelastic, as price fluctuates in response to supply. 
 + Fishers in this cooperative deal with this price variability by not leaving port when the price is too low for profit, they maintain their rigging for whiting when prices are low and are thus in a favorable position to take advantage of high prices when they occur. 
 + Part-time whiting fishermen lose critical time in changing their trawl nets to whiting nets. 
 + Fishers in the cooperative also have a particularly good channel to the sea. When prices are high, times when weather is bad, these cooperative fishers have better access to the sea. A major portion of their profits accrue during these times. 
 + Fishers in this cooperative maintain limited entry and a quota system. Limited entry is achieved by not letting others join the cooperative. New members are permitted only when their are retirements or deaths. Criteria for membership include kinship, proven experience and skill in fishing, evidence that the person is willing to work within the rules of the cooperative and room for new members. 
 + Quotas are assigned based on how much the manager can arrange to sell at an agreed-upon price. The manager sets a fleet quota. The captains that decide to go out communicate with each other and the manager by radio until the quota has been met. The catches are unloaded and the profits shared equally. This forestalls the incentive for overcapitalization of the fleet. Boat limits are also frequently set, and the enforcement varies over a week. At the beginning of the week it's loosely enforced: if a captain brings in more than he had a quota for he still recieves credit for the fish for which he had a quota. The rest of the fish goes on ice and is sold later that week. At the end of the week the captain recieves no credit for surplus and instead that fish profit is redistributed to captians that brought in less than their quotas. 
 + Captains that consistenly abuse the system are threatened with being ousted from the cooperative. 
 + Suggests that quotas and limited entry work, but captains have tried to institute broader quota systems in the region and failed. Likely because of the inequalities in access to the sea between ports. 
 + Think that to the extent that this scenario is generalizable it is that this management works well at a small scale because it is tied to the particular problems and circumstances of the people inherent in them. Also this management has a great deal of flexibility, allowing individual variation and the vagaries fo fish, weather and machines. It is tied to a specific problem and the benefits of restraint are experienced immediately in the price of whiting. 

## @McCay1981: Optimal foragers or political actors? Ecological analyses of a New Jersey Fishery (1981)
 tags: ["Empirical", "fishing", "Sociological"]

 + An interest in predictable relationships between environmental phenomena and human behavior remains at the core of ecological anthropology
 + Considers the ability of optimal foraging theory to explain the fishing strategies, technology and illegal fishing in a New Jersey fishery. 
 + The environmental problems fishermen face here are temporal variability, marine pollution, restrictions on access to marine resources and resource depletion. 
 + Seasonal variation is predictable but yearly variation in abundance is not. And becuase most of these fish are sent to a fresh fish market, prices are volatile. To some extent this variability is buffered by the species diversity present, so average variability is quite low. However the bulk of the biomass is menhaden, which is a very low value fish. The fishermen studied depend on food fishes, which are more variable and unpredictable. 
 + Some fishermen suggest that variability acts as a regulatory mechanism by selecting only for fishermen willing to ride out downswings in price and catch. 
 + Fishermen are also restricted by areas closed to particular types of gear and access to the sea at certain times of year. 
 + In order to apply optimal foraging theory, the costs and benefits of alternative strategies must be measured in a currency related to the goal being studied. However the data requirements are large, need to be able to independently rank the prey species according to location, behavior, nutrient value, etc. to determine to what extent the environment is heterogenous in opportunities provided to the forager. Also must measure the relative scale of environmental patches and the characteristics of prey species within them and assess temporal variability. 
 + Points out that fishing is one way that people in an industrialized society can maintain relative independence and gain personal satisfaction from their wrok. The penetration of capital and the organizational forms of capitalism into fishing has been halting and incompletel because of the great risks involved with what is essentially a foraging activity. *Management systems that reduce the uncertainty of fishing may attract more capital*. 

## @BockstaelOpaluch1983: Discrete modelling of supply response under uncertainty: The case of the fishery (1983)
 tags: ["Discrete Choice Model", "Empirical", "fishing"]

 - One of the first location choice model. 
 - Looks at fishery choice in New England fisheries
 - Assume that there’s ‘inertia’ which prevents fishermen from moving instantaneously to the fishery with highest profits. This may be monetary costs of converting vessel for use in another fishery or psychic costs associated with changing fisheries due to family tradition, preferences and fishery-specific knowledge and skills.
 - Assumes that uncertainty is important and so incorporates expectations about means and variances of returns. 
 - Use discrete choice model to predict fishing firms entry/exit decisions between fisheries. 
 - Assume that fishermen observe the returns received by vessels similar to theirs in each of the fishery alternatives available to them and form expectations on future returns based on these observations which was approximated by a geometric lag on past average annual returns by vessels of the same size from the same or related ports. 
 - Find that increased risk lowers probability of fishermen switching fisheries, and conclude that fishermen are risk averse.
 - Find that fishermen do respond to changes in expected profit opportunities, albeit with some 'sluggishness' 

## @MangelClark1983: Uncertainty, search, and information in fisheries (1983)
 tags: ["Theoretical", "fishing", "Data"]

 + Consider the problem of modeling uncertainty in the location of schools of fish and the effect of search by fishing vessels in reducing the uncertainty. 
 + Approach involves a preliminary period of searching and fishing, followed by a Bayesian update of information and a reallocation of vessels. 
 + The first search problem is how to determine the optimal allocation of search effort over several historical fishing grounds in which the current abundance of fish has a known prior probability distribution. 
 + The second case is when we have a single fishing ground and determine the optimal allocation of search effort over time. 
 + Assume that fishermen are profit maximizers and compare the value of competitive fishing strategies with cooperative ones in which search effort is optimized. 
 + Characterize the fisheries by the number of vessels in the fishery, the spatial resolution at which catch is measured (not necessary with VMS data), the number of species targeted, how well predictable variation is (seasonal or not?), how far fishermen have to travel and how long average trips are, whether movement between grounds is possible, whether information sharing is likely to occur, whether there is interference competition. 

## @Millington1984: The fishermen as predator: numerical responses of British Columbia gillnet fishermen to salmon abundance (1984) [NOT DONE - at pg 18]
 tags: ["Empirical", "Individual Variation", "Pred-Prey", "fishing"]

 + Identifies the basic concepts of a predator-prey system is the functional and numerical responses of the predator to the prey density. In this work examines how the numerical predator response (movement and aggregation of boats) is related to the density (measured in terms of the catch value). 
 + Considers three hypotheses to explain this movement: fixed or traditional movemetn (fixed behavior pattern), movement to maximize individual return (should equalize returns in all sites) and movement which maximizes returns but is modified by different foraging costs and benefits between sites. 
 + Identifies characteristics of predator and prey that should affect functional responses of predators. Includes
     * Density of the predator population
         - Essential
             + Exploitation: as predators compete for the same resource, the chance of discovering an unattacked prey decreases with increasing predator density
             + Interference: between competitors
         - Subsidiary
             + Social facilitation: social contact can stimulate an increase in predation with increasing predator density
             + Avoidance learning by prey: the greater the predator density, the greater the chance each prey acquire an effective way of avoiding attack
     * Density of the prey population
         - Essential
             + Rate of successful search
                 * reactive distance of predator to prey
                 * speed of predator movement
                 * speed of prey movement
                 * capture success
             + Time exposed to predators
                 * feeding versus nonfeeding times
             + Time spent handling prey
                 * pursuit time
                 * eating time
                 * time for digestive pause
         - Subsidary
             + Hunger
             + Learning by predator
             + Inhibition by prey: develop defense mechanisms
     * Predator characteristics
         - Swimming speed
         - Visual acuity
     * Prey characteristics
         - Caloric value of prey
         - Prey exposure time to predator
         - Prey attractiveness to predator 
             + Paletability
             + defense mechanisms
         - Strength of stimulus used by predator to locate prey
             + size of prey
             + habits of prey
             + colors of prey
     * Density and quality of alternate foods for the predators
         - Switching
 + Descriptions of interference competition are mostly anecdotal. Trawl skippers are known to misdirect other skippers to unproductive areas and seine skippers may sometimes indirectly interfere with the operation of another vessel. 
 + Some  evidence of territories forming, but these user rights are not generall accepted or automatic, so fishermen may have to compete for them by being first to fish there in a given season (and thus establishing temporary 'ownership') or occupying all good fishing locations with the gear. 
 + Social facilitation should increase the average fisherman's catch but this typicaly happens through private information channels (radio, etc.). But also disinformation is present with fishers being in competition with other company's boats, but boats from within the same firm as their survival in the hierarchy is measured relative to these other skippers. Disinformation shows up in with-holding of information, understated catches, over stated catches or radio silence. 
 + Found differences between gear-types: gillnet fishermen appear to be more bound by tradition (do not lear) and less by economic criteria than BC purse seine fishermen who have a far higher capital inviestment and more economic incentives to movement. 
 + Fishermen also frequently fish earlier in the year than expected to find out where fish are (fishing for information) or fish later to collect unemployment insurance. /

## @Eales-Wilen: An examination of fishing location choice in the pink shrimp fishery (1986)
 tags: ["Location choice", "RUM", "Data", "Empirical", "Discrete choice model", "fishing"]
 
 - First discrete choice model applied to location choice. 
 - Examines pink shrimp fishery
 - Few patches where 90% of shrimp are caught, but shrimp abundance varies due to turbidity, light changes and "grounds souring", so information degrades over time. 
 - Fishermen search for shrimp by making tows over areas likely to have good catches. So catches yield not just biomass, but information. 
 - Divides the fished area of the North Coast (of California) into three major shrimping beds and then subdivides down to 8 potential fishing areas. 
 - Data come from logbooks: time and date of set, location and time of lift and estimation of catch; port of landing, actual weight landed and comments. 
 - Had data for 17 boats
 - Fleet had variety of vessels averaging 56 ft, 30 net tons and 224 hp
 - Two thirds of the fleet had fished the previous season and average activity was 41 days fished. Most vessels fished single-day trips, but some larger vessels made trips lasting up to 4 days. 
 - Examines average catch per area, percent total sets per area and average catch per fishermen, but does not put these together: do all fishermen go to the same areas? Does large catch correspond to a particular type of behavior?
 - Used one season of data, 199-day season (April 16-Oct 31), 1976. 
 - Boats fished anywhere from 8-85 days
 - Some vessels tended to fish within a relatively restricted area, but most ranged over a wide area during the season. 
 - Split the fishing area arbitrarily, fishermen seemed to "clump" naturally into these eight areas and needed to "keep number of alternatives to computationally reasonable levels". 
 - Fishermen choose a location to make their first fishing effort according to recent information, and information tends to spread relatively rapidly because the fishermen are a small closely connected group. The information that spreads is typically yesterday's landings information. But as fishermen make their first set, new information is available and fishermen update their prior expectations and perhaps choose to move to a new location. 
 - Fishermen also form information-sharing groups in which wider areas are searched by groups of members and members converge on "hot spots" if travel costs permit. Thus for any given vessel making second and subsequent sets, it may be difficult to determine what (or whose) catch information should be included in the information set. 
 - Here restricted to fishermen's choices for the first set of the day. 
 - Null hypothesis is that yesterday's landings provide no valuable information about today's possibilities. If this is the case, we expect no more predictability than a random model (~13% correct predictions) for a given vessel facing the eight choices in our situation. 
 - Alternative model hypothesizes that information is valuable and that fishermen are informed and rational decision makers who select areas based on some notions of expected profits.  
 - Thus the probability that one particular site will be chosen is then assumed to be positively related to these expected profits. 
 - To measure expected profits used ad hoc estimate of expected catch and cost is distance from home port to each of the potential grounds.
 - Used regressed period $t$ catches in each area aginst those same means in period $t-1$. Yesterday's area-wide mean catch does help predict today's mean catch in most cases, but signifince levels were low in 3 of the 8 cases. Here environmental conditions or "grounds souring" by vessels ay be such that information dissipates more rapidly than other areas. 
 - Nested model (fishermen choose which of 3 major beds to visit and then choose subset of sub-areas) can explain ~ 60% of the time which is slighly higher than the non-nested model (can explain ~55% of the cases). The null model would explain 12.5%. 
 - Concludes fishing is an economically motivated activity, and that yesterday's landings are a good proxy for expectations regarding today's possibilities in this fishery. This is fishery specific, and we might expect to find fisheries in which information is persistent over several days or nearly instantaneous. 
 - This responsive movement by shrimp fishermen may imply that a large part of the fleet converges on yesterday's hotspots, temporarily fishing them otu and so on. Or perhaps the fleet spreads itself out over space in a manner determined by gaming behavior among fishermen. So fishermen's choice may be influced by perceptions of what other fishermen will do as it is by perceptions of what the fish are doing. 

## @SmithMcKelvey1986: Specialist and Generalist: roles for coping with variability (1986)
 tags: ["Individual Variation", "Fishing", "Theoretical", "Data"]

 + Evaluate efficent of two behavior patterns in fishermen: specialist and generalist in coping with market and natural variability. 
 + Make predictions for how these behaviors should respond to environment, and looks for those types of responses in empirical fishing data. 
 + Identify the assumption that most fisheries models assume fleet is homogenous and ignore stochasticity from natural and market variables. 
 + To the extent that the distribution of fishing behaviors is known and approaches a normal distribution, the homogeneity assumption may be justified.
 + Authors observe that there are two types of behavior: specalist and generalist. 
 + Contend that the mix of specialists and generalists varies with the stochastic variation in revenuse due to natural or market factors. 
 + Hypothesize that that the mix of specialists and generalists are part of the process by which society copes iwth variability. 
 + Define specialists as individuals which specialize exclusively in focal fishery, and the generalist is one who has alternative and nonfishery income options. Authors believe this is simplification, and that spectrum of strategies exist, but these are the two modes. 
 + Talk a lot about the differences between specalists and generalists, how they should respond to variability in revenue and then discuss a model as applied to a pink shrimp fishery.
 + Hypothesize that there are a fleet of specialized boats (shrimpers) which is supplemented by a back up fleet of general-purpose vessels (midwater trawlers) which ordinarily harvest groundfish. These backup boats are attracted into the shrimp fishery only in a good year. 
 + Dominant stochastic elements are taken to be annual recruitment variation and seasonsal shrimp market price, and for trawlers, the variable opportunity costs of foregoing their alternative fishery. 
 + With operating and opportunnity costs set at the beginning of the season, the wihtin-season operation of the fishery is modeled deterministically. 
 + Shrimp biomass declines according to fishing pressure, which is determined by the behavioral response of the fishermen to current prices, costs and stock levels. (No management?). 
 + Fishermen assumed to be profit-maximizers 
 + At beginning of season the size of the shrimper fleet is assumed to be constant, with individual fishermen treated capital cost as sunk. But there are annual start-up costs, so in a particularly poor season, some of the existing shrimper fleet may remain idle. Shrimpers that enter will fish until their marginal returns from shrimp drop to marginal costs. Trawlers, having alternate harvesting opportunities, will enter in such numbers as to balance their average net return against the obtainable return in the groundfish fishery. 
 + Assume that startup costs are less for shrimpers than groundfish trawlers, but marginal operating costs are more in groundfish trawlers than shrimpers. The difference in marginal costs comes from assuming that the shrimpers are more efficient in their target fishery and that groundfish trawls. The trawls have a lower startup cost than shrimpers because it's assumed that trawlers are fishing regardless.
 + Assume that the shrimp fishery operates under optimal management such that the smallest fleet capable of taking the harvest is fishing. In this way it's assumed that shrimpers are more efficient than trawlers in the shrimp fishery.
 + Provide anecdotal example of diver and drift gill netters. Drift gill netters are less specialized and less efficient: they drift their nets along the top of the water. Diver gill nets are more effeicient but more costly: they sweep along the bottom. Because they are on the bottom, they are more likely to catch debris which can damage the gear. This requires specialized tools (snag puller?) to remove debris. But this is also where the bigger chinook salmon are. Changes in season length tend to favor the drift gillnetters (the generalists). Diver gillnets have informal territories, which are a disadvantage in short seasons becuase they restrict the area in which they can fish. 
   
 + questions
   * From VMS data, it looks like pink shrimp boats are all mid-water trawlers? true? or are those the shrimpers and other declaration boats participate opportunistically?
   * There is no empirical evidence in the paper (yet) that these specialist and generalist strategies actually exist. Just vague references to the authors' own experience. 
   * How easy is it to get the permits to switch between shrimp and groundfish fishery?
   * How realistic is it that the shrimp fishery is managed optimally?

## @AbrahamsHealey1990: Variation in the Competitive Abilities of Fishermen and its Influence on the Spatial Distribution of the British Columbia Salmon Fleet (1990)
 tags: ["Empirical","Individual Variation", "fishing"]

 - Estimated catch rates of individaul fishing vessels in BC salmon troll fleet using 7 years of logbook data. 
 - Catch rate varied among vessels, some portion of it due to environmental variation, but also with vessel identity. 
 - The top ranked vessels had 3.6 times the catch of the lowest ranked vessels and were more successful catching fish in the same areas used by the bottom ranked vessels. 
 - Use IFD to develop a model that describes the expected relationship between vessel distribution, vessel catch rate and fish distribution which could be used as a tool for assessing fish stocks. 
 - Review IFD literature and the result that poor areas are more likely to be overused and good areas more likely to be underused. 
 - Salmon aggregatiosn are found in areas associated with steep slopes on the continental shelf and are identifiable from navigational charts. 
 - Examine the extent to which vessels deviate from the assumption of equal competitive ability which can be used to describe the extent to which the troll fleet should deviate from IFD and thus the predicted distribution of the troll fleet relative tot the distribution of the fishery. (Assumes that information is perfect, due to known habitat patches, but doesn't talk about depletion of those patches and ability for boats to move?)
 - Three classes of vessels: ady boats, ice boats adn freezer boats. Majority of boats in fleet are ice boats which perserve their catch with ice and undertake trips no longer than 2 weeks in duration. Day boats also preserve fish with ice but return to port daily to sell catch. Freezer boats also freeze catch but are largest and most sophisticated and only need to return to port with a full load or require supplies allowing them to fish continuously for periods in excess of 60 days. 
 - Typically trollers own and operate own vessel with help of hired hand. 
 - 26-86 vessels provided data, depending on the year. Vessels caught 6 different species of salmon. These fish vary in size and value and catch composition varied by vessel. 
 - To get total profit, assumed each fish of each species was equal to the weeks average weight of the species in the area in which it was caught. 
 - Assume that the goal of each skipper is to maximize the rate at which he made money, so it can be represented by the rate of accumulating income. So estimated this by dividing total cash value of daily catch divided by hours fishing (but doesn't take distance of patch into consideration)
 - Found that aggregate catch rates varied significantly from year to year (1986 catch rate was fourt imes than of 1983). This exceeded the range of variation that could be accounted for by price and is probably due to change in abundance of salmon. 
 - Also a significant effect of week on catch rates due to pink and sockeye salmon coming in later in the summer
 - Significant effect of area on catch rate. This was less consistent and predictable among years. 
 - There was a high variation in catch rate among vessels within a year. This could be attributable to environmental variation with some vessels bieng in the right place at the right time. 
 - To test for environmental variation compared the observed frequency distribtuion of catch with a null distribution in which all variation was environmentally determined. Constructed the competitive distribution of catch by calculating the number of standard deviates each vessel's catch rate was from the mean of all vessels that year (only for vessels which had at least 3 years of data). The frequency distribution was assumed to represent the range of competitive abilities within the fleet. Null distribution was calculated by using the observed data and randomly assigning each of the vessel a new catch rate for each year they had data for it (i.e. have catch data from 1981, 83, 86), assigned random average catch observed in those years (with replacement). This frequency distribution assumed to only be affected by spatial and temporal dynamics. If there are real differences in competitive ability the frequency distribution of competitive ability should be much broader then the environmental one. The null distribution shows much less variation in catch rates than the observed data, indicating that environmental variation alone cannot account for the observed range of catch rates and real differences in competitive ability must exist. 
 - Used top 5 and bottom 5 ranked vessels and examined absolute rates of catch and distribution of fishing effort. During this time average catch rate for top five vessels was 3.6 times that of the bottom vessels. And this ratio was 3.5 when vessels where in the same area at the same time. This suggests a difference between ability to catch fish rather than to find fish.
 - Top and bottom ranked vessels different in the time spent fishing in different statistical areas. All top vessels fished in a number of different areas while bottom vessels spent more than 75% of their time in a single or two adjacent areas.  
 - Used Shannon-Wiener diversity index to measure number of patches visited (vessels with lowest score visited only 1 patch). Found that diversity index positively correlated with proportion of sockeye in catch, suggesting that the broad distribution of effort may be a strategy to promote the capture of sockeye. A weak negative correlation existed between movemetn and the proportion of chinook in catch, and no other significant correlations existed for other species or diversity of species caught. 
 - Another factor which may affect competitive ability is vessel size. Found vessel length was positively correlated with catch rate, whether this is caused by a large vessel or competitive ability is unclear. However if mobility makes fishing easier, then having a larger boat would help. Vessel class had no significant effect 
 - Conclude that there is substantial variation in catch rate but source of this difference is less clear. 
 - Personal communication with fishermen suggest that large boats are better able to fish because they can maintain a constant speed even when buffeted by large waves. Another possibility is that only successful fishermen can afford to buy larger boats. 
 - Also this did not look at costs, so greater catch rate could be offset by great costs (i.e. fuel). 
 - Finally it may be that strategies are adopted depending on the decision of which species to fish for. Increased movement may be necessary if the troller wishes to follow schools of sockeye salmon as they migrate along the British Columbia coast. Area-restricted fishing may reflect the decisions to target Chinook salmon. Intermediate movement patterns represent less species specificity in harvesting. 

 - With top rated vessels being better than bottom ranked vessels in same areas, is it an issue of order? Do top rated vessels get there first? Or is it an issue of specialization? Are bottom ranked fishers infrequent fishers? Or area specialists elsewhere?
 - For the result that poor areas are more likely to be underused and good areas more likely to be overused, seems to be a good thing for persistence of a spatially structured species (source areas are left alone, sink areas targeted more). I wonder if technology could erode this difference, as people get better and better information. Would that erode sustainability of the stock? Seems like avoiding source areas for bycatch is working. 
 - Top and bottom ranked vessels different in the time spent fishing in different statistical areas. All top vessels fished in a number of different areas while bottom vessels spent more than 75% of their time in a single or two adjacent areas. Is this due to different vessel types? Can imagine costs of movement might be different. Or that bottom ranked fishers don't fish that often so don't build up experience?
 - Also what about replicated @HilbornLedbetter1979's work to see if area specialists were more likely to be drawn into a fishery in good years? Might explain why some vessels are so good. 

## @Dupont1993: Price uncertainty, expectations formation and fishers' location choices (1993)
 tags: ["Empirical", "Location choice models", "Price", "fishing"]

 - Uses an ARIMA model to construct price forecasts used by fishers which generates expected profits for three fishing locations in the BC salmon fishery. 
 - A RUM is estimated using two sets of regressors: seasonal profit and its variability and the second is expected wealth and its variability where expected wealth is the sum of the known pre-season wealth and the expected profitability of a given fishing location. 
 - Results show that expected profitability is a significant determinant of fishing location but that expected wealth plays an even bigger role. 
 - This suggests that there is a type of wealth or stock effect present in decisions made by fishers. 
 - Results provide evidence that variability of profits or wealth is generally less significant in regard to fishing location choice. In fact some fishers focus on greater variability, providing some evidence of risk-loving behavior. But not all fishers are the same, some are risk-neutral and some are risk-averse. 
 - Fishers do not know what prices they will obtain for their catches, but they must make decisions early in the season about where to fish since it is costly to change locations within a season. 
 - For model 1 utility is assumed to be a function solely of the seasonal profit from the current year's fishing. For model 2, utility is assumed to be a function of a fisher's wealth, where wealth is the sum of the known pre-season wealth and the fisher's profit from a given fishing location. 
 - Look at the BC salmon fishery which catches 5 sub species of salmon by four different vessel types (seine, troll, gillnet-troll and gillnet). 
 - Variation in price depends on species (chinook and coho obtain higher prices because they have a more desirable flesh texture), but the premia vary by species and over time. The time of year in which the fish contributes to price variation as well, with earlier catches commanding higher prices. Prices also vary by vessel type even for the same subspecies. Vessels using nets (seine, gillnet, and gillnet-troll) get lower prices than troll vessels because nets can leave unsightly burn marks on the skin. The price variation may be attributed to transportation costs of the purchasers, but location matters in terms of obtaining different prices for the same catch. 
 - Did not follow the math or logic for the price model. 
 - Suggest that habitat persistence: where costs are high to swtich from one location to another may be present. If it is important, risk-loving behavior might appear because fishers disregard the variability of returns in order to stay in a particular location. 
 - Emphasizes that different vessels need to be treated differently as different vessels have different behavior.

##  @Ruttan2003: Finding fish: grouping and catch-per-unit-effort in the Pacific hake fishery (2003)
 tags: ["Empirical", "Fishing", "Data"]

 + Used logbook data from the onshore processing sector of the Pacific hake fishery in Oregon from 1992 to 1996 to analyze the effect of grouping on CPUE and on search time. 
 + Looked at daily aggregations of vessels on fishing grounds and yearly information-sharing groups. 
 + Found that both groups are postiviely associated with CPUE, but in 1995 the result may be the artificial result of more vessels being drawn into the fishery by good contiions. 
 + Concludes that in non-1995 years, fisheres benfit from grouping by being able to find high-quality patches. Fishers in large groups also experienced lower search times from 1993 to 1995. 
 + However a pattern of declining effect of information-sharing groups from 1993-1996 suggests that fishers who were relatively new to this fishery became less reliant on information sharing networks for finding patches of fish, although fishers in large groups still may have benefited by being able to find higher quality patches. 
 + Group size defned as the number of vessels fishing in proximity to one another (aggregation size) and by the size of information-sharing groups. these groups are inferred from vessels that are observed fishing near each other more often than would be expected by chance. *but this seems like it would also assume information-sharing groups are groups of individuals that are drawn to the same places, regardless of each other..?*
 + Use @ClarkMangel1984, @ClarkMangel1986 foraging model and assume that search paths are random, boats are assumed to search independently, and encounter patches per unit time according to a Poisson random variable.
 + If fisher groups benefit from a reduction in search time then we would expect a positive correlation with the inverse of group size. 
 + According to @ClarkMangel1984, @ClarkMangel1986 information sharing is predicted as long as foragers are limited in how much they can harvest at one time, patches are large enough and scarce enough that groups can find them more quickly, and such patches or schools can "satiate" more than one vessel. 
 + *is this prediction actually present? what about the wilson paper. would be important to search out those few predictions to test*
 + Suggest that information sharing is principally with other vessels delievering to the same processor. But other work (Cove 1973) finds that non-owner operaters working for the same processor in Newfoundland in the 1960s do not share information, and only between captains that did not work for the same processor. The difference may come from the fact that vessels from different processors were not competing for the same crew. And with the Oregon hake fishers they claim to have an interest in enusuring the capital-intensive, surimi processing facilities stay afloat. Because hake degrades quickly, processors prefer to avoid gluts of fishing arriving at the docks and in turn fisheres avoid keeping fish in the hold for long periods even if it means returning to port without a full load. 

## @Stephensetal2007: Models of information use in Foraging behavior and ecology (2007)
 tags: ["Foraging theory", "review"]

 + Foraging animals obtain food and information about food resources as they feed
 + With patches being either *full* or *empty*, the forager (if it has perfect information) can adopt the proper behavior for each state or, if they don't have information, should adopt the response that on average does the best. 
 + Can calculate the average benefit that a well-informed forager obtains by calculating the average payoff that a forager adopting the best response for each state obtains. Can also calculate the average benefit that an uninformed forager obtatins by calculating the average behavior in all inflorescene types. The value of being informed is the difference between those two averages. 
 + Information is valuable when it can tell you something to change your behavior

 tags: ["Theoretical", "Pred-Prey", "Harvest"]

 + Constant harvest policies for fish and wildlife populations can lead to population collapse in the face of stochastic variation in population growth rates. 
 + Show that weak compensatory response by resource users or manageres to changing levels fo resource abundance can induce harvest cycles that accentuate the risk of population collapse. 
 + *Underscores possibility of information processing as a determinant of ability to track environmental quality, ie abundance and distribution of prey? and thus stability of cycle?*
