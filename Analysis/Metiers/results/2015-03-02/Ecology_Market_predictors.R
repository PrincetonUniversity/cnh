#' Fishermen have variable incomes. 
#'  
#' For each vessel it will be the weighted catch average of ports delivered to
#' 
#' ## ecology predictors 
#' 
#' + proportion area of fishable (i.e. non protected) area in X radius of port. (is there a large MPA blocking most near-shore fishermen?)
#' + proportion area of rock in X radius of port (heard that "rocks" were crucial to being able to do near-shore rockfish assemblages)
#' + proportion of rock habitat protected in X radius of port (no good if that habitat is all protected. Alternatively it could be positively associated due to spillover)
#' + proportion of rock habitat unprotected in X radius of port (reciprocal of above)
#' + do similar with "hard" habitat? or other types of habitat (mixed, soft)

#'## management predictors
#'
#'+ need to get Jameal the excel spreadsheet to classify how "open" each metier is
#'+ should look at how much area is protected (see above) -- another task for Jameal?
#'
#'## market predictors
#'
#'+ distance to major city (how to define -- i.e. Seattle, Portland, SF, LA)
#'+ number of first recievers (recievers are proxies for processors, more recievers, more options?)
#'+ evenness of first recievers (one processor effectively dominating?)
