## Background

Impacts of fishing

+ Shackell et al 2012: Spatial scale of similarity an indicator of metacommunity stability in exploited marine systems. Finds that decorrelation distance declined by 33% concomitant with declines in large bodied species. 
	- Was hypothesizing that fishing might homogenize habitat, but this suggests the opposite. That by getting rid of big fish, reduce connectivity of landscape and increase beta diversity. 
+ Mora et al. 2011 (PLOS One): documents that reef fish biodviersity and standing biomass is negatively correlated with human population density. 
	- suggests that human density is a good predictor of standing biomass. Regions with higher population density may make populations "weaker" due to pollution, runoff, landcover changes (again affecting runoff). 
+ Grizzle et al. 2009 (Fishery Bulletin): compares areas protected from trawling in Gulf of Maine after 6 years of protection. Return depended on substrate
	- Useful to show the reverse: what returns after fishing disappears. Might be an indication of what fishing causes.
