support for marine ebm comes from the realization that we can't understand (or manage) species in isolation. 

marine ebm is often mentioned alongside ecosystem services, and the importance of understanding what value people derive from these systems. 

marine ebm and ecosystem services falls into a larger conceptual framework of social-ecological systems, conceptualizing the system as two linked sub systems: human and ecological, that interact. 

understanding a marine system this way shows that we have made strides, conceptually at least, at understanding the complexity of the ocean. but we still have a single box where "people" are.

This is part of a broader historical shift from considering single species management to understanding the ecosystem context in which that species exists. Similarly, we tend to focus on a fishermen as a member of only the particular fishery we are considering. When in fact, just as fisheries are linked ecologically due to bycatch. Fisheries are also linked socially by individuals participating in more than one sector. 

This is obvious, but it is not reflected in the modeling or empirical studies of fishery systems. 

Here I present work that maps the human connections among fisheries.  I find functional groups of vessels, that link fisheries together in a non-random way and show that the structure of these networks is useful for understanding the context in which vessels participate in fisheries.
