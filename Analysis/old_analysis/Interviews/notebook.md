### Summary

+ I had a Skype meeting with Waldo 
+ I've had a phone call with Carla Guenther
+ I also have heard back from the Groundfish observer program
+ I have not contacted anyone yet

I think the next steps are 

+ conferring with Waldo to ask who he thinks we should target for key-informant interviews, 
+ contact Carrie Palmeroy right away to get more contacts in CA.
+ I will also bug Malin (and his wife Kristin) about people in CA to talk with since they were familiar with the fishing community down there. 

When we contact people on our list, we should use the same blurb, probably the one we sent Waldo:

> We’re part of an international project trying understand how fishermen choose where and when to fish – using both cues from the environment and from other fishermen. We hope results will be useful for helping management be more "bottom-up" and based on decisions fishermen make themselves. The research will using catch data for West Coast groundfish fisheries, but we’d like to start with understanding of the system from the fishermen, managers, and scientists themselves. We’d also love feedback as our research progresses, and plan to come back to discuss results with those interested in staying in touch. 


 I think our we should say: when is the best time to catch you between May-June, when's the worst? We'll be in touch again to try to pin you down once we confirm our travel plans. 

I think we should just start talking to debriefers over the phone. 

Details follow. 

### Talking with Waldo
Waldo said everyone he's talked to is very excited in chatting with us and we can feel free to get in contact with those he's connected with. 

We should be careful about mentioning that we're also talking with observers, as they are not universally loved. So if we don't have to mention it, let's not. 

Waldo has described us as 

> Working back in Princeton and interacting at the NW center in Seattle and do this project, and really want to get well grounded with the fisheries we're studying.

Some have asked if we will bring a survey with us, and Waldo said no, nothing like that. Much more informal. This agrees with the thought that at least some of these fishermen have survey-fatigue. 

### Chat with Carla Guenther
Carla was a classmate of James' at UCSB. Her dissertation was on the commercial spiny lobster fishery in CA, and spent a good deal of time getting to know, and interviewing, the fishermen. She now works for Penobscot East Resource Center which works to support sustainable Maine fisheries.[^2] I spoke with her on 3/14/2014. 

[^2]: Yes she knows Jim Wilson

Carla's main message was that it's imperative to do a few key informant interviews in the beginning of this process. These will be a couple hours long, with a few guys. The goal is to get a feel for the landscape, what are the most informative questions to ask? Also these informant interviews should be safe, ideally they can provide us the language to use and the terms/background/history to be familiar with so we don't make fools of ourselves.

The value of key informant interviews are that they can provide inormation on: what the history of the fleet is, where are the epicenters of the fleet? Some of the changes in fleet dynamics have happened over decades and some in the last few years.

To find people to do key informant interviews with, Carla recommends trying to target managers who are connected with the fishery and ask managers recommendations for who to interview. Specify, who’s a safe key informant for the fishery who can orient or guide me into the fleet? Who’s respected in the fleet? Hopefully the same person, and they can be the entry. So in interviews I can say “yeah talked with this person, they recommended I talked with you.”

People to look at for examples of use of interviews are Terasa Johnson, David Carr, Jennifer Berwer (East Carolian Uinveristy), Lisa Cambell at Duke. Also provided a few names in California of people to talk with. 

Also she has some notes about IRB:

> Your advisor needs to be approved as an IRB faculty. Each institution, the training for human subjects seems to be getting more and more standardized. So you might not need signatures, but informed consent. So maybe that’s a little cover letter describing the benefits and potential risks, and the confidentially aspect of things. That all goes into the cover letter for informed consent. I’m not going into financial or economic data could probably

Final advice:

> Fishermen want a report mailed to them at the end. That could be a format of my dissertation chapter, but preferably it’s a 2-3 page, "Here’s what we learned, thanks so much. Your participation helped us find out x, y, and z."" and it’s a really respectful way to say thanks for all your help.

Carla says we can offer them the full publications, but generally isn’t what they're interested in. 

She says that we should put some time into thinking about the potential negative repercussions that could come from participating in our interviews. It’s those unintended consequences that can harm future ability to work with these communities. In terms of writing something for IRB: “currently i’m unfamiliar with the political context but I intend to do these steps to figure it out” is probably sufficient. But do the real work before talking with fishermen. 

### Observer debriefers

Emailed Jon McVeigh, the head of the groundfish observer program. He passed me on to Ryan Shama to get a list of debriefers to contact. Ryan, very helpfully, sent me a list of debriefers, their locations, brief background, and contact info.
