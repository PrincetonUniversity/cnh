Papers useful for VMS segementation, interest in building a metapopulation model, and quantifying foraging strategies

metapopulations

+ [Beyond metacommunity paradigms: habitat configuration, life-history and movement shape an herbivore community on oak](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/15-0180.1)
  + Reviews general ideas about meta-community dynamics and analyzes what structures an insect meta-population community. Might give me some ideas of what is typically done wih meta-population analyses.


VMS

+ [Animal movement constraints improve resource selection inference in the presence of telemetry error. Brost et al. (in press). Ecology](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/15-0472.1)
  + Address error in location using seal GPS as example. Reviews some RSF analyses which are slightly different than behavioral segmentation since RSF both roles up location error and behavioral segmentation together.

Social behavior

+ [Reality mining of animal social systems. Krause et al. (2013) TREE](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713001468)
  + review of current methods
