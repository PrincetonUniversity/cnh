`cp2_7_tripIDVMS.Rdata`: used fish ticket data and cp mgmt_grp clustering to attribute relocations to particular trips. This is generated for vessels that have ever landed in the 2 or 7 catch profile (salmon or tuna). THe cluster column says which cluster the trip belonged to. The tripID is the trip number for that vessel (if a vessel had 3 trips the tripIDs would be 1,2,3 and trip IDs are not unqiue). To use the classification approach, would need to subset to just trips in particular cp (2 and 7, for example), and run classification approach for each trip.
