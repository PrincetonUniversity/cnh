The ideal result of this exercise will be a strategy which consists of a set of rules that an individual should follow to optimally harvest a resource. 

Ideas for getting started finding ideas are looking at the movement behavior literature, in particular both the seabird paper in Nature, Dee Boersma's penguin work and a paper Simon is on that shows seabirds change their movement due to fishing vessels.

## From social foraging theory @GiraldeauCaraco2000
Each set of decisions an animal makes while foraging leads to its own tradition of modeling. Two of the classical decisions are prey and patch choice. Luckily at a first approximation, fishermen are focused on a single type of prey (what they have a license for). While it's likely that fishermen may choose which are to exploit based on the likelihood of bycatch (if bycatch quotas are small), not going to worry about that at first. 

Social foraging theory has frequency-dependent payoffs. It depends what others are doing. That's a fundamental question, whether a fishermen responds on the water to what others are doing that I'm not sure of. RUM models assume that fishermen decide before they leave port where they'll go. But changing minds on the water is what I'm not sure of. 

Should look in data to see how long the trips are. If they are multiple days, more chance for updates? What's the distribution in trip length? Can I plot different boats on similar days and see whether they're going to the same or different locations?

Also are multiple fishermen in the same place and the same time? What's the overlap? That could be addressed by looking for overlap in some specified time window (from each time point are other fishermen in the same patch within 1 hour on either side?)
