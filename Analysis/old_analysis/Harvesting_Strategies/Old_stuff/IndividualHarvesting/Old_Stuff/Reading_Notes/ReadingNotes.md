The goal of this document is to hold all my reading notes related to the
review of existing studies that incorporate dynamically varying fishing
strategies and fish populations.

Introduction
============

Most studies that examine fishing consider harvesting strategy to be
fixed, and unresponsive to changes in fish populations. Here I review
literature that relaxes this assumption and models how fishermen’s
harvesting and fish population dynamics covary. Specifically I focus on
the questions these studies attempt to answer, the types models used
(structure and assumptions) and their results.

General overviews
=================

These are papers that do not specifically include models that resolve
fishermen harvesting strategy and fish population dynamics, but are
papers that put such an approach in a broader context.

Economics and Ecology of Open-Access Fisheries — @Fulleretal2013
----------------------------------------------------------------

Modeling papers
===============

These are papers that include a model that allows fishermen and fish to
covary.

Population level resolution
---------------------------

### Interactions between poaching and management policy affect marine reserves as conservation tools — @SethiHilborn2008

### Managing ecological thresholds in coupled environmental-human systems — @Horanetal2011

### Adaptive harvesting in a multiple-species coral-reef food web — @Kramer2008

### Using Fast and Slow Processes to Manage Resources with Thresholds — @Crepin2007

### A general model for simulation of stock and fleet dynamics in spatially heterogeneous fisheries — @HilbornWalters1987

Individual level resolution
---------------------------

### A simulation model of artisanal fisheries of Senegal — @LaloeSamba1991

### Information flow among fishing vessels modelled using a Bayesian network — @Littleetal2004

### Individual-based modelling of fishermen search behaviour with neural networks and reinforcement learning — @DreyfusLeon1999

### A spatial individual behaviour-based model approach of the yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean — @DreyfusLeonKleiber2001

Unknown resolution
------------------

Dynamics of discovery and exploitation: the case of the Scotian Shelf groundfish fisheries — @AllenMcGlade1986
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### An age-structured open-access fishery model — @McGarvey1994

Tangential at best
==================

Papers that don’t have dynamic fishing in them, but might be sources for
interesting questions.

Damped trophic cascades driven by fishing in model marine ecosystems — @AndersonPedersen2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible that trophic cascades will be interesting, or how fishing is
predicted to affect other fish species.

Why economics matters for understanding the effects of climate change on fisheries — @HayniePfeiffer2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguing generally for economic (i.e. human behavior) incentives to be
included in fisheries science. Might have good motivating questions that
would be of interest for our modeling framework.

Interaction strength combinations and the overfishing of a marine food web — @Bascompteetal2005
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How overfishing effects food webs. Again might have some pointers on why
including human behavior is important.

Previous work with model
========================

The background modeling structure we’re expanding on. Here the focus is
on the motivating questions and findings, rather than the model
structure which we’ll detail in our own methods.

Regime shifts in a social-ecological system — @Ladeetal2013
-----------------------------------------------------------

The survival of the conformist: social pressure and renewable resource management — @Tavonietal2012
