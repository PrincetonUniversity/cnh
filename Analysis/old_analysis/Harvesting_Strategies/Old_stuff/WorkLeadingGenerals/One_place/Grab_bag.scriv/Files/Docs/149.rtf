I propose to review existing empirical case-studies that describe when and where fishermen fish and characterize them according to system level charactersitics using a general framework similar to that found in Dynamic State Variable Modeling. This should allow comparison across variables to give a first understanding of how foraging strategy may depend on these characteristics. }
