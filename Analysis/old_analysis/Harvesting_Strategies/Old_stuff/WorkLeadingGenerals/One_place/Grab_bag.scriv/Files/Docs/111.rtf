Expected Results
\b0 \
The results will likely be that fishermen having a type III functional response introduce multiple stable states into the dynamics, and thus by human harvesting allow the possibility of critical transitions that were not present when fishing did not occur. Further I expect that this transitions between one stable state and another will be governed by the parameter values describing the harvesitng pattern and growth rate of the stock. Considering how these parameters change the landscape of stability may provide some insights into the way that a change in system characteristics can lead a previously stable fishery to collapse without having to increase harvest rates.  This may be important to management IF fishermen do indeed exhibt a type III functional response.}
