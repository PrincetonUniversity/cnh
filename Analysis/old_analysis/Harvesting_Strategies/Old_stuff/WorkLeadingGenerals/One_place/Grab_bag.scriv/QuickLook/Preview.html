Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is one of the most common forms of data used for fisheries management {Hilborn 1992}, and subject to considerable controversy, i.e. {Pauly 2013}. <br/>

CPUE rests on the idea that the amount of catch for a standardized unit of effort reflects the underlying abundance of the fish population targeted.

Fisheries science is focused on undestanding and managing fisheries, and hence deals with the intersection of ecological and economic forces and dynamics. Starting with the Gordon-Schaefer model (1954?) there has been a tradition of modeling dynamics of fisheries effort and harvested fish stocks to make predictions for how these two forces play out. The Gordon-Schaefer model made clear predictions that an open access fishery could expect a tragedy of the commons to...</p>

Fisheries systems are inhernetly a predator-prey system, with humans playing the predator. Similar to Lotka and Volterra's predator-prey model, effort is assumed constant in the Gordon-Schaefer model, and hence is expected to vary linearly with prey abundance. This same assumption is found in the Lotka-Volterra predator prey model, and is  based on ideal-free-gas. To relax this assumption in predator-prey models, {Holling 1959} introduced the idea of functional responses. ...</p>

That said, there are a number of case studies that look to determine fishermen's harvesting behavior over space, but none that consider feedbacks between the two subsystems. <br/>

As a first step in considering how incorporation of fishermen harvesting behavior can change ecological dynamics, I will analytically determine how changing a fisherman's functional response changes the dynamics of a fishery system. Here fishermen will have a type III functional response to fish rather than a linear one. Examining this harvesting equation graphically, the possibility of multiple stable states is immediately clear.<br/>

The results will likely be that fishermen having a type III functional response introduce multiple stable states into the dynamics, and thus by human harvesting allow the possibility of critical transitions that were not present when fishing did not occur. Further I expect that this transitions between one stable state and another will be governed by the parameter values describing the harvesitng pattern and growth rate of the stock. Considering how these parameters change the l...</p>

This project is phenomenological in approach and cannot consider what mechanisms may give rise to fishermen exhibiting such a functional response. In animal systems type III functional responses are typically attributed to prey switching or developing a search image, however it's not immediately obvious whether either mechanism may be found in fishermen in a fishery system. <br/>

Previous work on fisheries has primarily looked at the harvesting behavior of fishermen in two ways: either from a general perspective at a population level, or a case study at the level of the individual.<br/>

I propose to review existing empirical case-studies that describe when and where fishermen fish and characterize them according to system level charactersitics using a general framework similar to that found in Dynamic State Variable Modeling. This should allow comparison across variables to give a first understanding of how foraging strategy may depend on these characteristics. </p>

In dynamic state variable modeling, the decision of the individual depends on the current state of the individual, the state of the enviornment and what the likely next step will bring.  These states of the individaul and changes over time can be classified in four different dimensions for a fishery: ecology, gear, information, and management. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Individual -> Population</strong><br/>From individual to population level dynamics<br/>
From these charactersitics I will develop hypothesized foraging strategies and use a game-theoretic analysis in order to determine whether these are evolutionarily stable. Using these foraging strategies I can also scale up to look at what such strategies would mean at the population level, and how I might expect fish dynamics to respond. <br/>

This analysis will be carried out for commerical and artisanal fisheries. </p>
