	abstract = {Marine reserves, areas closed to all forms of fishing, continue to be advocated and implemented to supplement fisheries and conserve populations. However, although the reproductive potential of important fishery species can dramatically increase inside reserves, the extent to which larval offspring are exported and the relative contribution of reserves to recruitment in fished and protected populations are unknown. Using genetic parentage analyses, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for two species of exploited coral reef fish within a network of marine reserves on the Great Barrier Reef. In a 1,000 km(2) study area, populations resident in three reserves exported 83\% (coral trout, Plectropomus maculatus) and 55\% (stripey snapper, Lutjanus carponotatus) of assigned offspring to fished reefs, with the remainder having recruited to natal reserves or other reserves in the region. We estimate that reserves, which account for just 28\% of the local reef area, produced approximately half of all juvenile recruitment to both reserve and fished reefs within 30 km. Our results provide compelling evidence that adequately protected reserve networks can make a significant contribution to the replenishment of populations on both reserve and fished reefs at a scale that benefits local stakeholders}

	abstract = {Spillover of adult fish biomass is an expected benefit from no-take marine reserves to adjacent fisheries. Here, we show fisher-na\"ive behaviour in reef fishes also spills over from marine reserves, potentially increasing access to fishery benefits by making fishes more susceptible to spearguns. The distance at which two targeted families of fishes began to flee a potential fisher [flight initiation distance (FID)] was lower inside reserves than in fished areas, and this reduction extended outside reserve boundaries. Reduced FID persisted further outside reserves than increases in fish biomass. This finding could help increase stakeholder support for marine reserves and improve current models of spillover by informing estimates for spatial changes in catchability. Behavioural changes of fish could help explain differences between underwater visual census and catch data in quantifying the spatial extent of spillover from marine reserves, and should be considered in the management of adjacent fisheries}

	abstract = {Spatial distribution of fishing effort is increasingly recognised as an important consideration for fisheries management, as it can affect trends in catch rates, and be incorporated into planning of spatial management tools like marine protected areas (MPAs). One hundred and ninety-eight household questionnaires provided a coarse indication of effort distribution of artisanal lobster fishers around the Corn Islands, and 32 semi-structured interviews with skippers were used to map individual fishing sites and describe the operating costs and revenues of typical dive and trap-fishing operations. Artisanal fisheries had ranges of up to 50km, and had moved significantly offshore within the previous 10 years. At the scale of a 5x5 min latitude/longitude grid, trap fishing effort was highly aggregated, while diving had a regular dispersion. Descriptions of catch composition at each site showed a clear spatial pattern in the distribution of two locally recognised types of lobster, potentially indicating local stock structures. Economic information was summarised into balance sheets for typical fishers and suggested that fuel accounted for about 52 and 37\% of the operating costs of dive and trap fishing captains, respectively. Qualitative questions highlighted trap theft, adoption of geographical positioning system (GPS) technology and fuel costs as major factors affecting spatial behaviour. The costs and benefits of using more distant grounds were examined by testing for relationships between stated typical catch rates and distance of 90 trap-fishing grounds and between fuel expenditure and catches in 291 daily records of the activities of 3 divers. Maximum catch rates stated by trap fishers were significantly higher at more distant sites and daily catches by divers had a positive relationship with fuel expenditure, which suggested that increasing fuel expenditure to target more distant sites would lead to higher gross revenue as well as higher net revenues, after considering variable operating costs. Thus, there appears to be an economic incentive to extend the range of the fishery. However, fishers may not perceive these positive trends in catch rate with distance due to catch variability, and costs other than fuel, which complicate the trade-off between catch and distance.}

	abstract = {A challenge of managing data poor fisheries lies in overcoming uncertainties associated with a lack of information on biological and socio-economic conditions. This paper focuses on site prioritisation for marine protected areas, a process that usually imposes moderate to heavy demands on data, time, local expertise, and funds. A fuzzy logic decision support tool for zoning marine areas that is suitable for use in data poor conditions is developed. This tool, the Protected Area Suitability Index (PASI), assesses the suitability of sites for protection based on fishers preferences for that site and the sites conservation value. Only eight input attributes are required to run the PASI, which operates on a series of heuristic rules to estimate a site suitability score that ranges from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates that a site is highly suitable for being protected from fishing. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the \{PASI\} is relatively robust, and produces reliable results even as the system is degraded by the loss of data. Eighteen actively fished sites and 11 sites that are closed to fishing are assessed to evaluate how well the \{PASI\} is able to distinguish differences between sites. The estimated scores are significantly different (p<0.05), whereby non-fished sites are scored as being more suitable for protection than fished sites. The \{PASI\} can be used as a decision support tool to facilitate systematic marine spatial management under data poor conditions, especially in the task of identifying suitable sites for protection.}

	abstract = {Cooperatives are increasingly proposed as solutions for sustainable fisheries management. While individual case studies and economic theory suggest that cooperatives may manage fisheries effectively under some conditions, there is little empirical evidence comparing the actions of cooperative fisheries across a diverse set of environments. This study applies a standardized survey method to collect data from a set of cooperatively managed fisheries from around the globe, documenting their social, economic, and ecological settings as well as the cooperative behaviors in which they engage and the role they play in conservation. The resulting database covers 67 cooperatives from the major oceanic regions of the world, providing a unique overview of the global diversity of fishery cooperatives. It enables empirical analysis of the links between the characteristics and contexts of fisheries, such as the development status of the host nation, fisheries management practices, and species characteristics, and the collective actions taken by fishery cooperatives. The evidence shows that cooperatives form in a variety of development and governance contexts, and in diverse kinds of fisheries. Fishery cooperatives often take actions directed toward coordinating harvest activities, adopting and enforcing restrictions on fishing methods and effort, and taking direct conservation actions such as establishment of private marine protected areas.},

	abstract = {Use of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as an index of abundance relies on a range of assumptions that are often not met. Variation in habitat is likely to affect catch rates of species and consequently should be taken into account when estimating abundance from \{CPUE\} data, yet this is not generally possible due to a lack of spatially detailed habitat information. Mediterranean artisanal fisheries often operate in coastal areas where habitat is patchy, and consequently catches may not be related to effort if a portion of the gear has been set over unsuitable habitats for the target species. We investigate the effect of habitat patchiness on \{CPUE\} using bottom long-line by including detailed habitat and bathymetric information in the calculation of \{CPUE\} for eight commonly caught species. Comparison of \{CPUE\} estimated with and without taking into account habitat information showed exclusion of hooks in unfavourable habitats generally increases \{CPUE\} estimates for species of restricted mobility and strict habitat associations, while estimates for more mobile species, or those with lower habitat specificity, differ less. We also compare two methods for calculating habitat fished by each hook, one that used the habitat at the hook location, and another that included habitats within a 200\&\#xa0;m radius. The former method had the highest effect on CPUE. Results demonstrate habitat information can be usefully incorporated into \{CPUE\} estimates, while the effect on \{CPUE\} will vary depending on how specific specieshabitat preferences are.}

	abstract = {Biologists have repeatedly rediscovered classical models from physics predicting collision rates in an ideal gas. These models, and their two-dimensional analogues, have been used to predict rates and durations of encounters among animals or social groups that move randomly and independently, given population density, velocity, and distance at which an encounter occurs. They have helped to separate cases of mixed-species association based on behavioural attraction from those that simply reflect high population densities, and to detect cases of attraction or avoidance among conspecifics. They have been used to estimate the impact of population density, speeds of movement and size on rates of encounter between members of the opposite sex, between gametes, between predators and prey, and between observers and the individuals that they are counting. One limitation of published models has been that they predict rates of encounter, but give no means of determining whether observations differ significantly from predictions. Another uncertainty is the robustness of the predictions when animal movements deviate from the model's assumptions in specific, biologically relevant ways. Here, we review applications of the ideal gas model, derive extensions of the model to cover some more realistic movement patterns, correct several errors that have arisen in the literature, and show how to generate confidence limits for expected rates of encounter among independently moving individuals. We illustrate these results using data from mangabey monkeys originally used along with the ideal gas model to argue that groups avoid each other. Although agent-based simulations provide a more flexible alternative approach, the ideal gas model remains both a valuable null model and a useful, less onerous, approximation to biological reality}

	abstract = {Functional forms of predator-prey interactions are developed for predators optimally foraging on prey distributed in patches. The model uses mean free-path-length theory to develop functional forms for two idealized behaviors of prey in patches. For congregating prey that maintain a fixed density, for example, fish schools, the predation rate has a ratio-dependent form, and predator interference depends only on predator density. For sessile prey, which maintain a fixed patch size, a new predator-dependent form emerges in which predator interference depends on both prey and predator densities. The Beddington-DeAngelis equation is a special case of the sessile form. The model provides behavioral and biological criteria with which to select the functional form and ranges of coefficients appropriate for a particular food web. Finally, the model illustrates that behavior is an essential factor in predator-prey dynamics}

	abstract = {This article studies the effects of adaptive changes in predator and/or prey activities on the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey population dynamics. The model assumes the classical foraging-predation risk trade-offs: increased activity increases population growth rate, but it also increases mortality rate. The model considers three scenarios: prey only are adaptive, predators only are adaptive, and both species are adaptive. Under all these scenarios, the neutral stability of the classical Lotka-Volterra model is partially lost because the amplitude of maximum oscillation in species numbers is bounded, and the bound is independent of the initial population numbers. Moreover, if both prey and predators behave adaptively, the neutral stability can be completely lost, and a globally stable equilibrium would appear. This is because prey and/or predator switching leads to a piecewise constant prey (predator) isocline with a vertical (horizontal) part that limits the amplitude of oscillations in prey and predator numbers, exactly as suggested by Rosenzweig and MacArthur in their seminal work on graphical stability analysis of predator-prey systems. Prey and predator activities in a long-term run are calculated explicitly. This article shows that predictions based on short-term behavioral experiments may not correspond to long-term predictions when population dynamics are considered},

	abstract = {1. Ideal-free distribution theory assumes that in a patchy environment foragers maximize fitness and hence their feeding rate by balancing gains from more food against losses from more competition. Ultimately, individuals cannot increase their feeding rate by moving to another patch and they distribute themselves over patches in proportion to prey density per patch. 2. In our experiments with shore crabs Carcinus maenas foraging on two adjacent patches with mussels Mytilus edulis, the implicit assumption of ideal-free distribution theory that catch should match time spent in a prey patch is not met, however. Despite aggregating their attack where it is most profitable shore crabs distributed themselves homogeneously across mussel patches: they 'take away' the prey caught and consume it elsewhere to reduce interference. 3. Thus, predator distributions can be quite different from prey-attack distributions. This is important because the latter is shown to be decisive for persistence of predator and prey populations in ecological models},

	abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the stabilizing role that predator dispersal and aggregation have in the top-down regulation of predator-prey systems in a heterogeneous environment. We consider an environment consisting of sites interconnected by dispersal, and propose a novel mechanism of stabilization for the case with a non-sigmoid functional response of predators. We assume that the carrying capacity of the prey is infinitely large in each site, and show that successful top-down regulation of this otherwise globally unstable system is made possible through an interplay between the unevenness of prey fitness across the sites and the rapid food-dependent migration of predators. We argue that this mechanism of stabilization is different from those previously reported in the literature: in particular, it requires a high degree of synchronicity in local oscillations of species densities across the sites. Prey outbreaks take place synchronously, but the unevenness of prey growth rates across the sites results in a pronounced difference in the species densities, and so the predator quickly disperses to the sites with the highest prey abundances. For this reason, the consumption of prey mostly takes place in the sites with high densities of prey, which assures an efficient suppression of outbreaks. Furthermore, when the total size of prey population is low, the distribution of both species among the sites becomes more even, and this prevents overconsumption of the prey by the predator. Finally, we put forward the hypothesis that this mechanism, when considered in a tri-trophic plankton community in the water column, can explain the stability of the nutrient-rich low-chlorophyll open ocean regions},

Usually, the predator and the prey populations are assumed to be homogeneous, i.e. all individuals behave in the same way. In this work, we shall take into account different tactics that predators can use for exploiting a common self-reproducing resource, the prey population. Predators fight together in order to keep or to have access to captured prey individuals. Individual predators can use two behavioural tactics when they encounter to dispute a prey, the classical hawk and dove tactics. We assume two different time scales. The fast time scale corresponds to the inter-specific searching and handling for the prey by the predators and the intra-specific fighting between the predators. The slow time scale corresponds to the (logistic) growth of the prey population and mortality of the predator. We take advantage of the two time scales to reduce the dimension of the model and to obtain an aggregated model that describes the dynamics of the total predator and prey densities at the slow time scale. We present the bifurcation analysis of the model and the effects of the different predator tactics on persistence and stability of the prey-predator community are discussed},

So long as there is adequate compliance by the fishing community, it is likely that they will also sustain and even enhance fishery yields in the surrounding area. However, there are significant gaps in scientific knowledge that must be filled if no-take reserves are to be used effectively as fishery management tools. Unfortunately, these gaps are being glossed over by some uncritical advocacy. Here, we review the science, identify the most crucial gaps, and suggest ways to fill them, so that a promising management tool can help meet the growing challenges faced by coastal marine fisheries}

	abstract = {The rapid increase in the science and implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the world in the past 15 years is now being followed by similar increases in the science and application of marine ecosystem-based management (EBM). Despite important overlaps and some common goals, these two approaches have remained either separated in the literature and in conservation and management efforts or treated as if they are one and the same. In the cases when connections are acknowledged, there is often little assessment of if or how well MPAs can achieve specific EBM goals. Here we start by critically evaluating commonalities and differences between MPAs and EBM. Next, we use global analyses to show where and how much no-take marine reserves can be expected to contribute to EBM goals, specifically by reducing the cumulative impacts of stressors on ocean ecosystems. These analyses revealed large stretches of coastal oceans where reserves can play a major role in reducing cumulative impacts and thus improving overall ocean condition, at the same time highlighting the limitations of marine reserves as a single tool to achieve comprehensive EBM. Ultimately, better synergies between these two burgeoning approaches provide opportunities to greatly benefit ocean health}

	abstract = {The science of spatial fisheries management, which combines ecology, oceanography, and economics, has matured significantly. As a result, there have been recent advances in exploiting spatially explicit data to develop spatially explicit management policies, such as networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). However, when data are sparse, spatially explicit policies become less viable, and we must instead rely on blunt policies such as total allowable catches or imprecisely configured networks of MPAs. Therefore, spatial information has the potential to change management approaches and thus has value. We develop a general framework within which to analyze the value of information for spatial fisheries management and apply that framework to several US Pacific coast fisheries. We find that improved spatial information can increase fishery value significantly (>10\% in our simulations), and that it changes dramatically the efficient management approach-switching from diffuse effort everywhere to a strategy where fishing is spatially targeted, with some areas under intensive harvest and others closed to fishing. Using all available information, even when incomplete, is essential to management success and may as much as double fishery value relative to using (admittedly incorrect) assumptions commonly invoked}

	abstract = {The creation of marine reserves is often controversial. For decisionmakers, trying to find compromises, an understanding of the timing, magnitude, and incidence of the costs of a reserve is critical. Understanding the costs, in turn, requires consideration of not just the direct financial costs but also the opportunity costs associated with reserves. We use a discrete choice model of commercial fishermen's behavior to examine both the short-run and long-run opportunity costs of marine reserves. Our results can help policymakers recognize the factors influencing commercial fishermen's responses to reserve proposals. More generally, we highlight the potential drivers behind the political economy of marine reserves}

	abstract = {Decadal-scale observations of marine reserves suggest that indirect effects on taxa that occur through cascading trophic interactions take longer to develop than direct effects on target species. Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species (SE) was 5.13  1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13.1  2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2  1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1  1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration}

Few studies have objectively and simultaneously examined the types of MPAs that are most effective in conserving reef resources and the socioeconomic factors responsible for effective conservation [4-6]. We simultaneously explored measures of reef and socioeconomic conservation success at four national parks, four comanaged reserves, and three traditionally managed areas in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Underwater visual censuses of key ecological indicators [7, 8] revealed that the average size and biomass of fishes were higher in all areas under traditional management and at one comanaged reserve when compared to nearby unmanaged areas. Socioeconomic assessments [6, 9, 10] revealed that this "effective conservation" was positively related to compliance, visibility of the reserve, and length of time the management had been in place but negatively related to market integration, wealth, and village population size. We suggest that in cases where the resources for enforcement are lacking, management regimes that are designed to meet community goals can achieve greater compliance and subsequent conservation success than regimes designed primarily for biodiversity conservation}

	abstract = {The ecosystem goods and services provided by coral reefs are critical to the social and economic welfare of hundreds of millions of people, overwhelmingly in developing countries [1]. Widespread reef degradation is severely eroding these goods and services, but the socioeconomic factors shaping the ways that societies use coral reefs are poorly understood [2]. We examine relationships between human population density, a multidimensional index of socioeconomic development, reef complexity, and the condition of coral reef fish populations in five countries across the Indian Ocean. In fished sites, fish biomass was negatively related to human population density, but it was best explained by reef complexity and a U-shaped relationship with socioeconomic development. The biomass of reef fishes was four times lower at locations with intermediate levels of economic development than at locations with both low and high development. In contrast, average biomass inside fishery closures was three times higher than in fished sites and was not associated with socioeconomic development. Sustaining coral reef fisheries requires an integrated approach that uses tools such as protected areas to quickly build reef resources while also building capacities and capital in societies over longer time frames to address the complex underlying causes of reef degradation}

Look at how predator preferences for different prey types alters the dynamics of a predator-prey system where the predator has positive frequency-dependent predation. Assume that the predator adaptively adjusts a trait that determines the relative capture rates of the two prey species. Find that the predator always lags behind the trait level which would produce the optimal consumption rate based on the current abundance of each prey type.

	abstract = {Although it is recognized that marine wild-capture fisheries are an important source of food for much of the world, the cost of sustainable capture fisheries to species diversity is uncertain, and it is often questioned whether industrial fisheries can be managed sustainably. We evaluated the trade-off among sustainable food production, profitability, and conservation objectives in the groundfish bottom-trawl fishery off the U.S. West Coast, where depletion (i.e., reduction in abundance) of six rockfish species (Sebastes) is of particular concern. Trade-offs are inherent in this multispecies fishery because there is limited capacity to target species individually. From population models and catch of 34 stocks of bottom fish, we calculated the relation between harvest rate, long-term yield (i.e., total weight of fish caught), profit, and depletion of each species. In our models, annual ecosystem-wide yield from all 34 stocks was maximized with an overall 5.4\% harvest rate, but profit was maximized at a 2.8\% harvest rate. When we reduced harvest rates to the level (2.2\% harvest rate) at which no stocks collapsed (<10\% of unfished levels), biomass harvested was 76\% of the maximum sustainable yield and profit 89\% of maximum. A harvest rate under which no stocks fell below the biomass that produced maximum sustainable yield (1\% harvest rate), resulted in 45\% of potential yield and 67\% of potential profit. Major reductions in catch in the late 1990s led to increase in the biomass of the most depleted stocks, but this rebuilding resulted in the loss of >30\% of total sustainable yield, whereas yield lost from stock depletion was 3\% of total sustainable yield. There are clear conservation benefits to lower harvest rates, but avoiding overfishing of all stocks in a multispecies fishery carries a substantial cost in terms of lost yield and profit}

	abstract = {There is considerable variability in the status of fish populations around the world and a poor understanding of how specific management characteristics affect populations. Overfishing is a major problem in many fisheries, but in some regions the recent tendency has been to exploit stocks at levels below their maximum sustainable yield. In Western North American groundfish fisheries, the status of individual stocks and management systems among regions are highly variable. In this paper, we show the current status of groundfish stocks from Alaska, British Columbia, and the U.S. West Coast, and quantify the influence on stock status of six management tactics often hypothesized to affect groundfish. These tactics are: the use of harvest control rules with estimated biological reference points; seasonal closures; marine reserves; bycatch constraints; individual quotas (i.e., 'catch shares'); and gear type. Despite the high commercial value of many groundfish and consequent incentives for maintaining stocks at their most productive levels, most stocks were managed extremely conservatively, with current exploitation rates at only 40\% of management targets and biomass 33\% above target biomass on average. Catches rarely exceeded TACs but on occasion were far below TACs (mean catch:TAC ratio of 57\%); approximately \$150 million of potential landed value was foregone annually by underutilizing TACs. The use of individual quotas, marine reserves, and harvest control rules with estimated limit reference points had little overall effect on stock status. More valuable fisheries were maintained closer to management targets and were less variable over time than stocks with lower catches or ex-vessel prices. Together these results suggest there is no single effective management measure for meeting conservation objectives; if scientifically established quotas are set and enforced, a variety of means can be used to ensure that exploitation rates and biomass levels are near to or more conservative than management targets}

This rich body of research helps to inform conservation planning for marine ecosystems but also poses new challenges for further study, including how to best design integrated fisheries management and conservation systems, how to effectively evaluate the performance of entire reserve networks, and how to examine the complex coupling between ecological and socioeconomic responses to reserve networks},

	abstract = {In this article the patch and diet choice models of the optimal foraging theory are reanalyzed with respect to evolutionary stability of the optimal foraging strategies. In their original setting these fundamental models consider a single consumer only and the resulting fitness functions are both frequency and density independent. Such fitness functions do not allow us to apply the classical game theoretical methods to study an evolutionary stability of optimal foraging strategies for competing animals. In this article frequency and density dependent fitness functions of optimal foraging are derived by separation of time scales in an underlying population dynamical model and corresponding evolutionarily stable strategies are calculated. Contrary to the classical foraging models the results of the present article predict that partial preferences occur in optimal foraging strategies as a consequence of the ecological feedback of consumer preferences on consumer fitness. In the case of the patch occupation model these partial preferences correspond to the ideal free distribution concept while in the case of the diet choice model they correspond to the partial inclusion of the less profitable prey type in predators diet}

Recent experimental work indicates that such variation can have significant ecological effects. However, ecological models typically disregard this variation and focus instead on trait means and total population density. Under what situations is this simplification appropriate? Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait evolution}

These conjectures are explored using models of two-patch consumer-resource systems with fitness dependent consumer movement and cyclic dynamics in at least one of the patches; neither conjecture applies generally to such systems. Under relatively low heterogeneity, highly accurate and rapid adaptive movement most often increases both the between-patch correlation of density and the variation in the total density of both species compared to a similar system having a low rate of random movement. However, such adaptive movement can decrease between-patch correlation and global population variability when (1) the consumer's movement is moderately sensitive to fitness differences and heterogeneity is relatively low, or (2) one of the patches would be stable in isolation, and the stable patch supports a sufficiently large consumer population. In both cases, the dynamics are typically either a stable equilibrium or a simple anti-phase cycle with low variation in total population size. Under adaptive movement, population variability is often lowest for intermediate levels of heterogeneity, but monotonic increases or decreases with increasing spatial heterogeneity are possible, depending on the fitness sensitivity of movement and how the characteristic that differs between patches affects within-patch stability and population size. High rates of random movement can lead to greater stability than adaptive movement when consumers are very efficient},

	abstract = {Abstract Movements made by real organisms--such as movements involved in dispersal, migration, and habitat selection--are expected to occasionally be suboptimal because of realistic constraints imposed by incomplete information, perceptual limitations, and stochasticity. Previous theory considering such constraints has shown that movements appropriately conditioned on habitat or resource characteristics can balance out suboptimal components of movement and thereby lead organisms to ideal free distributions and fitness maxima, whereas movements conditioned on fitness differentials cannot. These findings suggest a somewhat paradoxical hypothesis: even if organisms have information about their fitness, movement strategies that maximize fitness may be conditioned on something other than fitness per se. We test this hypothesis by investigating the evolutionary stability of generalized, conditional movement strategies that vary in their use of information on fitness versus information on habitat characteristics. We show that when costs of sensory machinery are included, natural selection should favor movement strategies that completely ignore fitness information. Finally, we synthesize previous work by showing how several previous important theoretical results for adaptive movement strategies are united under our one general model}

	abstract = {The Humboldt Current System (HCS) sustains the world's largest small pelagic fishery. While a cooling of this system has been observed during recent decades, there is debate about the potential impacts of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on upwelling dynamics and productivity. Recent studies suggest that under increased atmospheric CO2 scenarios the oceanic stratification may strongly increase and upwelling-favorable winds may remain nearly constant off Peru and increase off Chile. Here we investigate the impact of such climatic conditions on egg and larval dispersal phases, a key stage of small pelagic fish reproduction. We used larval retention rate in a predefined nursery area to provide a proxy for the recruitment level. Numerical experiments are based on hydrodynamics downscaled to the HCS from global simulations forced by pre-industrial (PI), 2xCO2 and 4xCO2 scenarios. A biogeochemical model is applied to the PI and 4xCO2 scenarios in order to define a time-variable nursery area where larval survival is optimum. We test two distinct values of the oxycline depth that limits larval vertical distribution: one corresponding to the present-day situation and the other corresponding to a shallower oxycline potentially produced by climate change. It appeared that larval retention over the continental shelf increases with enhanced stratification due to regional warming. However, this increase in retention is largely compensated for by a decrease of the nursery area and the shoaling of the oxycline. The underlying dynamics are explained by a combination of stratification effects and mesoscale activity changes. Our results therefore show that future climate change may significantly reduce fish capacity in the HCS with strong ecological, economic and social consequences. \copyright 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd}

Past single-species hypotheses examining the economic plausibility of exploiting rare species have argued that the escalating value of rarity allows extinction to be profitable. We describe an alternative pathway toward extinction in multispecies exploitation systems, termed 'opportunistic exploitation'. In this mode, highly valued species that are targeted first by fishing, hunting, and logging become rare, but their populations can decline further through opportunistic exploitation while more common but less desirable species are targeted. Effectively, expanding exploitation to more species subsidizes the eventual extinction of valuable species at low densities. Managers need to recognize conditions that permit opportunistic depletion and pass regulations to protect highly desirable species when exploitation can expand to other species},
	notes = {() This looks at how opportunist exploitation of valuable and rare species can drive them to extinction. This seems really similar to the idea that if a predator is subsidized by alternate prey, it can keep up predation pressure on prey species at low abundance.}

Transferrable and marketable fishing privileges, including permits and quotas, make it possible to use private-sector transactions as conservation strategies to address some fishery management issues. Abating the effects of bottom trawling on the seafloor and bycatch and discard associated with the practice has proven challenging. On the Central Coast of California, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Environmental Defense Fund, local fishers and local, state, and federal authorities worked collaboratively to protect large areas of the seafloor from bottom trawling for groundfish while addressing economic impacts of trawl closures. Contingent on the adoption of trawl-closure areas by a federal regulatory agency, TNC used private funds to purchase federal groundfish trawl permits and vessels from willing sellers. Trawl-closure areas were designed collaboratively by combining regional biological diversity and fisheries data with local fishers' knowledge. The private transactional strategy was designed to remedy some deficiencies in previous federal buyouts, to mitigate economic impacts from trawl closures, and to carefully align with a public regulatory process to protect "essential fish habitat" under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This collaborative effort protected 1.5 million ha (3.8 million acres) of seafloor, reduced trawl effort in the area by 50\%, and set a precedent for collaborative partnerships between conservation and fishing interests. This is the first time a large conservation organization has taken an ownership position in a fishery and demonstrates how nongovernmental organizations can invest in fisheries to improve environmental and economic performance.

	abstract = {Recovery of overexploited marine populations has been slow, and most remain below target biomass levels. A key question is whether this is due to insufficient reductions in harvest rates or the erosion of population resilience. Using a global meta-analysis of overfished stocks, we find that resilience of those stocks subjected to moderate levels of overfishing is enhanced, not compromised, offering the possibility of swift recovery. However, prolonged intense overexploitation, especially for collapsed stocks, not only delays rebuilding but also substantially increases the uncertainty in recovery times, despite predictable influences of fishing and life history. Timely and decisive reductions in harvest rates could mitigate this uncertainty. Instead, current harvest and low biomass levels render recovery improbable for the majority of the world's depleted stocks}

	notes = {() Steve Pacala prompted me to think about for what type of species would fine scale harvesting patterns matter. In particular, he suggested that species that are size structured (substantial ontogenic shift in habitat due to size), and tend to self-assort by size, ought to be more sensitive in numerical dynamics to fishing patterns.  
I have found a paper, \{Gaylord 2005\}, which looks at how size structure changes the yields that MPAs return to fisheries. In this paper they find that MPAs will increase fisheries yields most for species that experience density dependence after dispersal, and that have sedentary, long-lived adults.  
Gives some ideas for crucial components to include for ecology: - That all fish species have at least two distinct phases: larval (which includes dispersal) and fish 
Methods Here they use an integrodifference equation with Gaussian dispersal. They assume symmetric dispersal and that adults dont move from where they are dispersed to. Also assume Beverton-Holt/Ricker density dependence either before or after larvae are dispersed.  
They add two stages to the model in order to capture the fact that older, larger adults tend to build up inside reserves. This change means that larvae not only compete with each other, but also with already-resident adults. They also assume that older adults have twice the reproductive rate as newly dispersed individuals, trying to mimic the fact that big adults are more fecund. Also assume that older individuals weigh 1.5x that of newly dispersed individuals. Again to account for increased biomass inside reserves. Both adults and juveniles are assumed to have the same natural survival rate, and juveniles move into the adult class at rate gamma.  
Fishing is implemented either traditionally or with MPA reserves. Traditional fishing is some specified fraction of the individuals are fished out uniformly across all space. With MPAs there is some fraction of land set aside from which no fishing takes place, while fishing occurs without restriction everywhere else.  
Notes This means that they assume that theres no spatial structure to the fish population except that imposed by MPAs.  
Results Unsurprisingly, when pre-dispersal density dependence is present for a population that is not size structured, MPAs do worse than than traditional fishing in terms of fisheries yields. This is because the increase in fish density inside reserves reduces larval production.  
When size-structure is considered the MPAs effectiveness is amplified.  
Main conclusions MPAs should be extremely helpful for species that have post-dispersal density dependence, and adults whose fecundity increases with size and are sedentary.}

	abstract = {Theoretical ecology is largely founded on the principle of mass action, in which uncoordinated populations of predators and prey move in a random and well-mixed fashion across a featureless landscape. The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities. This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator-prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems},
	notes = {(1041) (1041) (1041) (1042) (1041) (1041) (1041) (1041) Isn't this the definition of being in a group? If prey-group density was equla to individual density, it would mean that each individual was in a group of 1, i.e. individual. So if you have a group size greater than 1, then don't you automatically fulfill this condition?}

	abstract = {A growing push to implement catch share fishery programs is based partly on the recognition that they may provide stronger incentives for ecological stewardship than conventional fisheries management. Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard rates, use of habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 catch share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that catch share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts of catch share programs were measured through comparisons of fisheries with catch shares to fisheries without catch shares or by comparing fisheries before and after catch shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by catch share implementation: only discard rate, which declined significantly in catch share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, catch share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, discard rate, and the ratio of catch to catch quotas. These impacts of catch shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent of the number of years that catch share programs had been in place. These findings suggest that for the indicators examined, the primary effect of catch shares was greater consistency over time. This enhanced consistency could be beneficial to fishery systems and might also be an indication of more effective management}

A linear model was fitted to log-transformed commercial catch per unit effort data in the spawning hoki trawl fishery off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The residuals from this model were examined; catch rates from tows done by different vessels at different times of day are standardized and, therefore, comparable. There is evidence that vessels make decisions about where to fish based on both their own recent catch history and on observations about the location and aggregation of other vessels. There is no evidence that there is enough information transfer for vessels to make decisions on the basis of catch rates of the other vessels in the fleet.}

We used 30 years of data from Ghana to link mammal declines to the bushmeat trade and to spatial and temporal changes in the availability of fish. We show that years of poor fish supply coincided with increased hunting in nature reserves and sharp declines in biomass of 41 wildlife species. Local market data provide evidence of a direct link between fish supply and subsequent bushmeat demand in villages and show bushmeat's role as a dietary staple in the region. Our results emphasize the urgent need to develop cheap protein alternatives to bushmeat and to improve fisheries management by foreign and domestic fleets to avert extinctions of tropical wildlife}

	abstract = {Implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires a clear conceptual and quantitative framework for assessing how different harvest options can modify benefits to ecosystem and human beneficiaries. We address this social-ecological need for Pacific salmon fisheries, which are economically valuable but intercept much of the annual pulse of nutrient subsidies that salmon provide to terrestrial and aquatic food webs. We used grizzly bears, vectors of salmon nutrients and animals with densities strongly coupled to salmon abundance, as surrogates for "salmon ecosystem" function. Combining salmon biomass and stock-recruitment data with stable isotope analysis, we assess potential tradeoffs between fishery yields and bear population densities for six sockeye salmon stocks in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and British Columbia (BC), Canada. For the coastal stocks, we find that both bear densities and fishery yields would increase substantially if ecosystem allocations of salmon increase from currently applied lower to upper goals and beyond. This aligning of benefits comes at a potential cost, however, with the possibility of forgoing harvests in low productivity years. In contrast, we detect acute tradeoffs between bear densities and fishery yields in interior stocks within the Fraser River, BC, where biomass from other salmon species is low. There, increasing salmon allocations to ecosystems would benefit threatened bear populations at the cost of reduced long-term yields. To resolve this conflict, we propose an EBFM goal that values fisheries and bears (and by extension, the ecosystem) equally. At such targets, ecosystem benefits are unexpectedly large compared with losses in fishery yields. To explore other management options, we generate tradeoff curves that provide stock-specific accounting of the expected loss to fishers and gain to bears as more salmon escape the fishery. Our approach, modified to suit multiple scenarios, provides a generalizable method to resolve conflicts over shared resources in other systems}

	abstract = {This article uses simple models to explore the impact of adaptive movement by consumers on the population dynamics of a consumer-resource metacommunity consisting of two identical patches. Consumer-resource interactions within a patch are described by the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, and these dynamics are assumed to be cyclic in the absence of movement. The per capita movement rate from one patch to the other is an increasing function of the difference between the per capita birth minus death rate in the destination patch and that in the currently occupied patch. Several variations on this model are considered. Results show that adaptive movement frequently creates anti-phase cycles in the two patches; these suppress the predator-prey cycle and lead to low temporal variation of the total population sizes of both species. Paradoxically, even when movement is very sensitive to the fitness difference between patches, perfect synchrony of patches is often much less likely than in comparable systems with random movement. Under these circumstances adaptive movement of consumers often generates differences in the average properties of the two patches. In addition, mean global densities and responses to global perturbations often differ greatly from similar systems with no movement or random movement},

Looks at how sensitive system dynamics are to how fast predators move depending on differences between patches.(100) (100) These sources might be good for other options on movement function(106) (105) This is useful. I think that the local-movement rule seems the most intuitive. Maybe fishermen don't know what's going on at the other patch, but this one is pretty bad.. THis gives me the opportunity to implement some sort of replicator dynamics. To the Appendix!(100) What's happening in this present study.(100) Again, this is what I'm using for my own model}

	abstract = {Economics of the fishery has focused on the wastefulness of common pool resource exploitation. Pure open access fisheries dissipate economic rents and degrade biological stocks. Biologically managed fisheries also dissipate rents but are thought to hold biological stocks at desired levels. We develop and estimate an empirical bioeconomic model of the Gulf of Mexico gag fishery that questions the presumptive success of biological management. Unlike previous bioeconomic life history studies, we provide a way to circumvent calibration problems by embedding our estimation routine directly in the dynamic bioeconomic model. We nest a standard biological management model that accounts for complex life history characteristics of the gag. Biological intuition suggests that a spawning season closure will reduce fishing pressure and increase stocks, and simulations of the biological management model confirm this finding. However, simulations of the empirical bioeconomic model reach the opposite conclusion; total fishing increases and stocks decline. The behavioral response to the closure is so pronounced that it more than offsets the restriction in allowable fishing days. Our results suggest that failure to account for fishing behavior plays an important role in fishery management failures.},

Incorporation of this extra variability into simple models for fisheries leads to the prediction of a nonlinear relationship between catch rates per unit fishing effort and the abundance of fish. Given fractional changes in abundance are predicted to yield lesser fractional changes in catch rates. The extent of this nonlinearity can only partially be inferred from the distribution of the catches.}

	abstract = {Biodiverse coastal zones are often areas of intense fishing pressure due to the high relative density of fishing capacity in these nearshore regions. Although overcapacity is one of the central challenges to fisheries sustainability in coastal zones, accurate estimates of fishing pressure in coastal zones are limited, hampering the assessment of the direct and collateral impacts (e.g., habitat degradation, bycatch) of fishing. We compiled a comprehensive database of fishing effort metrics and the corresponding spatial limits of fisheries and used a spatial analysis program (FEET) to map fishing effort density (measured as boat-meters per km$^{2}$) in the coastal zones of six ocean regions. We also considered the utility of a number of socioeconomic variables as indicators of fishing pressure at the national level; fishing density increased as a function of population size and decreased as a function of coastline length. Our mapping exercise points to intra and interregional 'hotspots' of coastal fishing pressure. The significant and intuitive relationships we found between fishing density and population size and coastline length may help with coarse regional characterizations of fishing pressure. However, spatially-delimited fishing effort data are needed to accurately map fishing hotspots, i.e., areas of intense fishing activity. We suggest that estimates of fishing effort, not just target catch or yield, serve as a necessary measure of fishing activity, which is a key link to evaluating sustainability and environmental impacts of coastal fisheries}

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using data from the UK Government Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) deployed on UK-registered large fishing vessels we investigate patterns of fisheries activity on annual and seasonal scales. Analysis of VMS data shows that regions of the UK European continental shelf (i.e. Western Channel and Celtic Sea, Northern North Sea and the Goban Spur) receive consistently greater fisheries pressure than the rest of the UK continental shelf fishing zone.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: VMS provides a unique and independent method from which to derive patterns of spatially and temporally explicit fisheries activity. Such information may feed into ecosystem management plans seeking to achieve sustainable fisheries while minimising putative risk to non-target species (e.g. cetaceans, seabirds and elasmobranchs) and habitats of conservation concern. With multilateral collaboration VMS technologies may offer an important solution to quantifying and managing ecosystem disturbance, particularly on the high-seas}

	abstract = {Many species of baleen whales were hunted to near extinction in the Southern Hemisphere. The recovery of these populations will be affected by the availability of krill, a major dietary component, in the Southern Ocean. We combine a novel energetics model for baleen whales with a state dependent foraging model to explore the impacts of an expanding krill fishery on baleen whales. We parameterize the model for blue whales, but with simple modifications it could be applied to most baleen whales. We predict that an expanding fishery will have a small but significant impact on the blue whale population through decreased birth rates. However, spreading the catch limit throughout the range of krill can reduce these effects. In addition, whales may be able to reduce these impacts through adaptive changes in foraging behavior. The relationship between krill abundance and blue whale foraging and reproductive success is nonlinear, such that larger reductions in krill biomass, potentially following a loss of sea ice due to climate change, could have a much larger negative impact on the recovery of blue whales.}

These decisions, moreover, must be relevant to the characteristics of the fisheries and the stocks being exploited. The development of management strategies must be based, therefore, on an understanding of the overall fisheries system and linkages among its components. Based on recent examples in Europe and North America, we discuss how a failure to understand the linkages in the fisheries system may lead to management strategies that fail to achieve their objectives, and how an understanding of these linkages can inform the development of strategies that are more likely to achieve policy objectives.},
	notes = {() Fishery management has a limited set of knowledge it uses for creating and implementing management plans. Specifically, it's biological information that's used. 
Provides examples of three cases of cod management plans that failed. Argues that it was because social and economic conditions were not considered, and those because major obstacles to implementing the management plan. 
Also didn't think that the data that determined the HCR would be uncertain. That uncertainty undermined the validity of the HCR.() When management decisions have not resulted in the outcomes predicted by models, biolgical modellers see this as a symptom of imperfection in the models. 
In response projections of fish populations were developed that included the impacts of fisheries, but also included how data would be produced and assessments made (MSE I think).() Apparently the inclusive managing approach was pioneered by the International Whaling Comission. And has since been expanded to a concept of fisheries system that 'not only considered the feeback within the assessment model, but identified explicitly the specific social activities and institutions constituting the feedback.
I guess there's no specific example, and this is referring to a 'concept' being developed. Which is a concept, I think, that I am using.
Also a mention of biologists being asked to predict social effects for a North Atlantic European Cod recovery plan. Doesn't say how it went, except that there were tensions. Citation: Wilson and Delany, 2005}

	abstract = {Evaluating the success of natural resource management approaches requires methods to measure performance against biological, economic, social, and governance objectives. In fisheries, most research has focused on industrial sectors, with the contributions to global resource use by small-scale and indigenous hunters and fishers undervalued. Globally, the small-scale fisheries sector alone employs some 38 million people who share common challenges in balancing livelihood and lifestyle choices. We used as a case study a fishery with both traditional indigenous and commercial sectors to develop a framework to bridge the gap between quantitative bio-economic models and more qualitative social analyses. For many indigenous communities, communalism rather than capitalism underlies fishers' perspectives and aspirations, and we find there are complicated and often unanticipated trade-offs between economic and social objectives. Our results highlight that market-based management options might score highly in a capitalistic society, but have negative repercussions on community coherence and equity in societies with a strong communal ethic. There are complex trade-offs between economic indicators, such as profit, and social indicators, such as lifestyle preferences. Our approach makes explicit the "triple bottom line" sustainability objectives involving trade-offs between economic, social, and biological performance, and is thus directly applicable to most natural resource management decision-making situations},

	abstract = {The utility of traditional bio-economic harvest models suffers from their dependence on two commonly used approaches. First, optimization is often assumed for harvester behavior despite system complexity and the often neglected costs associated with information gathering and deliberation. Second, ecosystem interactions are infrequently modeled despite a growing awareness that these interactions are important. This paper develops a simulation model to examine the consequences of harvesting at two trophic levels in a coral-reef food web. The model assumes adaptive rather than optimizing behavior among fishermen. The consequences of changing economic, biological, and social parameters are examined using resilience as an evaluative framework. Three general conclusions are reached. First, the simulated ecosystem is sensitive to small changes in economic, biological, and social parameters. Second, threshold effects are common. Third, as compared to results typical of traditional single-species optimization models, some results are counter-intuitive. Benefits of this approach are that the model affirms and adds to the results of traditional bio-economic harvest models, is empirically operational, and provides a richer selection of policy alternatives. Finally, the analysis of trade-offs in terms of resilience provides a useful evaluative framework for multiple-species harvest models.},
	notes = {(18) True?(18) () Questions:
What is 'a framework of resilience'
Resilience as a framework means that he's going to look to see how the system responds to shocks and how long it takes to regenerate. 
How is 'adaptive harvest' different from optimizing harvest?
As far as I can tell it's 'replicator dynamics' which i think means the same thing as a genetic algorithm, which means that agents switch from less to more successful strategies, and thus the proportion of the individuals using a strategy in the population is proportional to the success of hte strategy.(18) (17)}

	abstract = {Understanding cooperation in animal social groups remains a significant challenge for evolutionary theory. Observed behaviours that benefit others but incur some cost appear incompatible with classical notions of natural selection; however, these behaviours may be explained by concepts such as inclusive fitness, reciprocity, intra-specific mutualism or manipulation. In this work, we examine a seemingly altruistic behaviour, the active recruitment of conspecifics to a food resource through signalling. Here collective, cooperative behaviour may provide highly nonlinear benefits to individuals, since group functionality has the potential to be far greater than the sum of the component parts, for example by enabling the effective tracking of a dynamic resource. We show that due to this effect, signalling to others is an evolutionarily stable strategy under certain environmental conditions, even when there is a cost associated to this behaviour. While exploitation is possible, in the limiting case of a sparse, ephemeral but locally abundant nutrient source, a given environmental profile will support a fixed number of signalling individuals. Through a quantitative analysis, this effective carrying capacity for cooperation is related to the characteristic length and time scales of the resource field}

	abstract = {Research attempting to predict the effect of climate change on fisheries often neglects to consider how harvesters respond to changing economic, institutional, and environmental conditions, which leads to the overly simplistic prediction of fisheries follow fish. However, climate effects on fisheries can be complex because they arise through physical, biological, and economic mechanisms that interact or may not be well understood. Although most researchers find it obvious to include physical and biological factors in predicting the effects of climate change on fisheries, the behaviour of fish harvesters also matters for these predictions. A general but succinct conceptual framework for investigating the effects of climate change on fisheries that incorporates the biological and economic factors that determine how fisheries operate is presented. The use of this framework will result in more complete, re-liable, and relevant investigations of the effects of climate change on fisheries. The uncertainty surrounding long-term projections, however, is inherent in the complexity of the system.},

First, alternative fishing trip choices of this fleet were identified using multi-variate statistical methods based on species landings weighted by value and defined as distinct fishing activity or fisheries (termed metiers). A RUM was specified, which included trip components as attributes during the period 2001- 2004 (a lagged percentage of the value per unit of effort of the main species caught, total value per unit of effort, and inertia in terms of changes from one metier to another). For the main metiers, the proportion of correct effort allocation is 90\% during the calibration period of 2001-2004. The results from the RUM are used to parameterize a simulation model of trip choice. The model is used to predict trip choices in 2005, throughout most of which fishing was constrained by the closure of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) fishery. Simulation results are compared with observed trip choices following the fishing ban: 80\% of observed trip choices are correctly predicted by the model. The capacity of the behavioral model to predict responses to the closure is then discussed.},

	abstract = {Beginning in the 1960s, ecologists, mathe-maticians, and economists started developing a class of mod-els, which today are referred to as bioeconomic models. These early models started with a difference or differential equation describing the dynamics of a biological resource. To this equa-tion one might add a second difference or differential equation describing the dynamics of harvesting effort. Alternatively, one could formulate a dynamic optimization problem seeking to maximize discounted net benefit. These models provided important insights into the tragedy of the commons and poli-cies that might promote optimal management. By the 1970s, more complex models were developed incorporating multi-species interactions, age-structured populations, and models with stochastic growth. In the late 1990s, spatial bioeconomic models were developed in recognition of the importance of location when managing biological resources. The objectives of this survey are to: (i) review some of the early models in bioeconomics, (ii) present some of the key spatial models in bioeconomics that have been used to assess the value of ma-rine (no-take) reserves, and (iii) speculate on the direction of future research in spatial bioeconomics.},

Each case began with a series of in-depth interviews with local fishers, after which their answers were examined using both social and biological approaches to assess the possibility of using the information as the basis of simple, valid and locally acceptable indictors for fisheries management. We found that allocation and knowledge issues are closely interlinked and must be addressed in concert, and that the negotiation of shared understandings between multiple sources of knowledge must be a continuous process within an adaptive framework rather than a question of identifying a fixed set of indicators.}

Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described, their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis, where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis, where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis, where even though production is related to population abundance, there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis, where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3\% of stocks, the regimes hypothesis 38.6\%, the mixed hypothesis 30.5\%, and the random hypothesis 12.6\%. Fisheries management agencies need to recognize that irregular changes in productivity are common and that harvest regulation and management targets may need to be adjusted whenever productivity changes},
	notes = {(1) Cool! So this relates to my idea about what tracking variable fishermen use. And the feedbacks between fishermen and ecosystem state. Would be worthwhile to restrict analysis to fisheries where recruitment is abundance related. Otherwise behavior won't have any effect on ecological variables.
However, still interesting to see how foraging (movement) behavior changes in relation to changing abundance of fish. Or even if that's the tracing variable that matters most to fishermen. Maybe it does on a slow timescale. That it affects their opinion about the need for management...}

	abstract = {Reaction of fishers is an essential source of uncertainty in implementing fishery management decisions. Provided they realistically capture fisher behaviour, models of fishing vessel dynamics provide the basis for evaluating the impact of proposed management strategies. Information flow among vessels has not been a major focus of such models however, although it might play a critical role in how a fleet responds to changes to management restrictions or levels of a resource. Such a response might then modify subsequent exploitation of the resource. In this paper, a spatially-explicit model of vessel fishing behaviour is developed for a line fishery on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Vessel behaviour is conditioned on past catch and effort data at a spatial resolution of 6 $\times$ 6 nautical mile grid cells. For each vessel, the probability of fishing a particular grid cell is determined from past income per unit effort experienced at that location, and the cost of steaming to it. The probability distribution across all possible grid cells represents a particular vessels perspective. This perspective is modified by information conveyed by other vessels using Bayesian-network information propagation. The information conveyed is the effort distribution of other vessels and is equivalent to a vessel watching where other vessels fish. We compare the behaviours that vessels display when they act independently with those they display when they watch each other, and show the effect that such information flow can have on a resource. Information flow among fishing vessels can be shown to have an effect on the dynamics and resource exploitation of a simulated fishery.}

	abstract = {A model to mimic the search behaviour of fishermen is built with two neural networks to cope with two separate decision-making processes in fishing activities. One neural network deals with decisions to stay or move to new fishing grounds and the other is constructed for the purpose of finding prey within the fishing areas. Some similarities with the behaviour of real fishermen are found: concentrated local search once a prey has been located to increase the probability of remaining near a prey patch and the straightforward movement to other fishing grounds. The artificial fisherman prefers areas near the port when conditions in different fishing grounds are similar or when there is high uncertainty in its world. In the latter case a reluctance to navigate to other areas is observed. The artificial fisherman selects areas with higher concentration of prey, even if they are far from the port of departure, unless a high uncertainty is related to the fishing ground. Connected areas are preferred and followed in orderly fashion if a higher catch is expected. The observed behaviour of the artificial fisherman in uncertain scenarios can be described as a risk-averse attitude. The approach seems appropriate for an individual-based modelling of fishery systems, focusing on the learning and adaptive characteristics of fishermen and on interactions that take place at a fine scale.}

	abstract = {Emerging recognition of two fundamental errors underpinning past polices for natural resource issues heralds awareness of the need for a worldwide fundamental change in thinking and in practice of environmental management. The first error has been an implicit assumption that ecosystem responses to human use are linear, predictable and controllable. The second has been an assumption that human and natural systems can be treated independently. However, evidence that has been accumulating in diverse regions all over the world suggests that natural and social systems behave in nonlinear ways, exhibit marked thresholds in their dynamics, and that social-ecological systems act as strongly coupled, complex and evolving integrated systems. This article is a summary of a report prepared on behalf of the Environmental Advisory Council to the Swedish Government, as input to the process of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa in 26 August 4 September 2002. We use the concept of resilience--the capacity to buffer change, learn and develop--as a framework for understanding how to sustain and enhance adaptive capacity in a complex world of rapid transformations. Two useful tools for resilience-building in social-ecological systems are structured scenarios and active adaptive management. These tools require and facilitate a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options}

	abstract = {The poor management of natural resources has led in many cases to the decline and extirpation of populations. Recent advances in fisheries science could revolutionize management of harvested stocks by evaluating management scenarios in a virtual world by including stakeholders and by assessing its robustness to uncertainty. These advances have been synthesized into a framework, management strategy evaluation (MSE), which has hitherto not been used in terrestrial conservation. We review the potential of MSE to transform terrestrial conservation, emphasizing that the behavior of individual harvesters must be included because harvester compliance with management rules has been a major challenge in conservation. Incorporating resource user decision-making required to make MSEs relevant to terrestrial conservation will also advance fisheries science}

Using a multi-species bioeconomic model for a Caribbean reef community, we determine the optimal harvesting rates for predator and prey species and ask how this more comprehensive optimiza-tion differs from traditional single-species approaches. We also identify trade-offs when the objective of the manager includes nonfishing values. We find that the optimal solution when accounting for nonfishing values can include temporary or permanent fishing moratoriums in contrast to continuous fish-ing at low levels when only fishing profits are considered. We also show that the greatest gains from ecosystem-based fishery management are not from im-proved estimation of the trophic coupling, but from reforming the social and economic management of individual fish stocks and by explicitly incorporating a broader set of values into management decisions.},

	abstract = {Many ecosystems appear subject to regime shifts--abrupt changes from one state to another after crossing a threshold or tipping point. Thresholds and their associated stability landscapes are determined within a coupled socioeconomic-ecological system (SES) where human choices, including those of managers, are feedback responses. Prior work has made one of two assumptions about managers: that they face no institutional constraints, in which case the SES may be managed to be fairly robust to shocks and tipping points are of little importance, or that managers are rigidly constrained with no flexibility to adapt, in which case the inferred thresholds may poorly reflect actual managerial flexibility. We model a multidimensional SES to investigate how alternative institutions affect SES stability landscapes and alter tipping points. With institutionally dependent human feedbacks, the stability landscape depends on institutional arrangements. Strong institutions that account for feedback responses create the possibility for desirable states of the world and can cause undesirable states to cease to exist. Intermediate institutions interact with ecological relationships to determine the existence and nature of tipping points. Finally, weak institutions can eliminate tipping points so that only undesirable states of the world remain}

In all cases, fishing fleets behave rationally within the imposed regulatory structures. Successful, generalist fishermen who take risks often pioneer developing fisheries. At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive in-vestment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas). In senescent fisheries, vessel buyback programs must account for the fishing power of individuals and their vessels. Subsidies should be avoided as they prolong the transition towards alternative employment. Fisheries managers need to create individual incentives that align fleet dynamics and fishermen behavior with the intended soci-etal goals. These incentives can be created both through management systems like dedicated access privileges and through market forces.},

	abstract = {Understanding the behavior of fishermen is a key ingredient to successful fisheries management. The aggregate behavior of fishing fleets can be predicted and managed with appropriate incentives. To determine appropriate incentives, we should look to successes to learn what works and what does not. In different fisheries incentive systems have been found to reduce the race-for-fish and make fisheries profitable, to stimulate stock rebuilding, to reduce bycatch, and to provide for reductions in illegal fishing. Yet, success can be evaluated in many dimensions, but is, in fact, rarely done - per cent overfished seems to be the dominant measure of performance. I evaluate the yield lost due to overfishing in several ecosystems and contrast the situation of North Atlantic cod where considerable yield is lost, to fisheries in New Zealand and the west coast of the USA where lost yield due to overfishing is very small. Much more systematic evaluation of the other aspects of fisheries performance is greatly needed. From examples explored in this paper I conclude that prevention of overfishing can be achieved with strong central governments enforcing conservative catch regulations, but economic success appears to require an appropriate incentive structure.},

	abstract = {Collective action is more likely to occur and to be effective when it is consistent with the self-interest of the affected individuals. The Maine lobster fishery is an instructive example of biological and technological circumstances combining with individual self-interest to create conditions favorable to collective action. The model describes the way social structure emerges from the adaptive behavior of competing fishers. Fishers compete in two ways: in a scramble to find the lobsters first and by directly interfering in other fishers ability to compete, i.e., by cutting their traps. Both forms of competition lead fishers to interact frequently and to self-organize into relatively small groups. They learn to restrain their competitive behavior toward their neighbors but do not extend that same restraint to non-neighbors. Groups work within well defined boundaries, contact one another frequently, actively exchange information about the resource, and, most importantly, depend on continuing mutual restraint for their economic well-being. These self-organizing, competitive processes lay the foundation for successful collective action, i.e., mutual agreements that create the additional restraint required for conservation. The modeling approach we use is a combined multi-agent and classifier systems simulation. The model allows us to simulate the dynamic adaptation (learning) of multiple individuals interacting in a complex, changing environment and, consequently, provides a way to analyze the fine-scale processes that emerge as the broad social- ecological patterns of the fishery. Patterns generated by the model are compared with patterns observed in a large dataset collected by 44 Maine fishers.}

Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured non-randomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the co-occurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat.},

We used a range of ecosystem models to explore the effects of fishing low-trophic level species on marine ecosystems, including marine mammals and seabirds, and on other commercially important species. In five well-studied ecosystems, we found that fishing these species at conventional maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels can have large impacts on other parts of the ecosystem, particularly when they constitute a high proportion of the biomass in the ecosystem or are highly connected in the food web. Halving exploitation rates would result in much lower impacts on marine ecosystems while still achieving 80\% of MSY},

The below reference isn't very recent. Just discusses the need for more modeling, not a guide to what's been done. 
12. A. J. Constable et al., ICES J. Mar. Sci. 57, 778 (2000). (1150) () Used 3 different ecosystem models on 5 different LME and simulated how different levels of harvest of low trophic level (LTL) species influenced abundance of other species.
Only simulated single species harvesting, and no harvesting of upper trophic level species. 
Chose 40\% change in abundance relative to baseline was threshold for effects to be considered. The more LTL species harvested, the more ecological groups displayed an effect. But no clear pattern (extent of change varied). 
Both positive and negative effects, sea birds and mammals had mostly negative effects but most of those negative effects were also small. Same goes for commercial species. 
Which LTL species harvest caused the big effects varied: i.e. anchovy in Humboldt ecosystem had big effects, sardine low. In southern Benguela ecosystem sardines had the big impact, and both species had low impacts in Australian and California current ecosystems. 
Found trophic level was not a good predictor, but relative abundance and connectance did explain some variation (Peruvian anchovy accounts for up to 35\% of consumer biomass in the northern Humboldt system).(1149) () Wonder whether they characterized at all the functional redundancy in these webs. Probably would have to dive into the supplementary materials to get at it.(1150) This, combined with a comment that sand eels in the North Sea had particularly large effects makes me think functional redundancy is mostly what's important here.(1149)}

	abstract = {There are many examples of ecological theory informing fishery management. Yet fisheries also provide tremendous opportunities to test ecological theory through large-scale, repeated, and well-documented perturbations of natural systems. Although treating fisheries as experiments presents several challenges, few comparable tests exist at the ecosystem scale. Experimental manipulations of fish populations in lakes have been widely used to develop and test ecological theory. Controlled manipulation of fish populations in open marine systems is rarely possible, but fisheries data provide a valuable substitute for such manipulations. To highlight the value of marine fisheries data, we review leading ecological theories that have been empirically tested using such data. For example, density dependence has been examined through meta-analysis of spawning stock and recruitment data to show that compensation (higher population growth) occurs commonly when populations are reduced to low levels, while depensation (the Allee effect) is rare. As populations decline, spatial changes typically involve populations contracting into high-density core habitats while abandoning less productive habitats. Fishing down predators may result in trophic cascades, possibly shifting entire ecosystems into alternate stable states, although alternate states can be maintained by both ecological processes and continued fishing pressure. Conversely, depleting low trophic level groups may affect central-place foragers, although these bottom-up effects rarely appear to impact fishperhaps because many fish populations have been reduced to the point that they are no longer prey limited. Fisheries provide empirical tests for diversity-stability relations: catch data suggest that more diverse systems recover faster and provide more stable returns than less diverse systems. Fisheries have also provided examples of the tragedy of the commons, as well as counter-examples where common property resources have been managed successfully. We also address two barriers to use of fisheries data to answer ecological questions: differences in terminology for similar concepts and misuse of records of fishery landings (catch data) as a proxy for biomass trends.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the changes in quantitative marine fisheries management between 1985 and 2010. The two primary areas where quantitative methods have been employed are in the assessment of stock size and exploitation rates, and in the design and evaluation of harvest strategies. In 1985, some areas had well established assessment programs in place, and the assessment methods have been relatively stable over the 25 years in question. In other places, the evolution of methods has been much more dramatic, and where there were either no assessments performed or early virtual population analysis (VPA) was done using mainly catch-at-age data, complex statistical models using maximum likelihood or Bayesian statistics are now common. Harvest strategies have generally evolved even more. In 1985, most harvest strategies were based on fixed exploitation rates from yield-per-recruit analyses. By 2010, most agencies had adopted harvest strategies that specifically reduced exploitation rates as abundance dropped below the biomass that will produce maximum sustainable yield. Simulation testing of these harvest strategies has become an integral part of their design, often using the uncertainty from the assessments to bound the robustness trials for the harvest strategy. Two major areas of new quantitative methods are (i) spatially explicit models that can be used for marine spatial planning, and (ii) in ecosystem models to evaluate ecosystem wide impacts of fishing.}

	abstract = {There are differences in perception of the status of fisheries around the world that may partly stem from how data on trends in catches over time have been used. On the basis of catch trends, it has been suggested that about 70\% of all stocks are overexploited due to unsustainable harvesting and 30\% of all stocks have collapsed to <10\% of unfished levels. Catch trends also suggest that over time an increasing number of stocks will be overexploited and collapsed. We evaluated how use of catch data affects assessment of fisheries stock status. We analyzed simulated random catch data with no trend. We examined well-studied stocks classified as collapsed on the basis of catch data to determine whether these stocks actually were collapsed. We also used stock assessments to compare stock status derived from catch data with status derived from biomass data. Status of stocks derived from catch trends was almost identical to what one would expect if catches were randomly generated with no trend. Most classifications of collapse assigned on the basis of catch data were due to taxonomic reclassification, regulatory changes in fisheries, and market changes. In our comparison of biomass data with catch trends, catch trends overestimated the percentage of overexploited and collapsed stocks. Although our biomass data were primarily from industrial fisheries in developed countries, the status of these stocks estimated from catch data was similar to the status of stocks in the rest of the world estimated from catch data. We conclude that at present 28-33\% of all stocks are overexploited and 7-13\% of all stocks are collapsed. Additionally, the proportion of fished stocks that are overexploited or collapsed has been fairly stable in recent years}

	abstract = {The complex systemic nature of fisheries was recognized by scientists many decades ago but the at-tempts to take this evidence into consideration in day-to-day management processes have been slow, patchy and of limited effectiveness. Clearly, there remains an implementation challenge in this regard; the present paper examines the essential nature of fishery systems and linkages, why the im-plementation challenge persists, and some key new directions. After a brief introduction, an historical review is provided of the evolution of fisheries assessment and modelling, highlighting the growing complexity resulting from changing social demands. The complexity syndrome is described in terms of scope, boundaries, scales, components and linkages within the fishery system. These aspects can cause losses in understanding, predictability and controllability, owing to delays, teleconnections, scale de-pendence, and self-organizational capacity. Key issues addressed relate to systemic aspects of fisheries governance and of the fishery research needed to support it. Particular reference is made to the changes needed to adapt to the new emerging relations between science, policy-making and society within complex fishery systems, and between those systems and their environment. A range of concepts and approaches, such as integrated assessment, is elaborated as epistemological and operational frameworks to support the transition process. The conclusion looks at the evolution of the global fishery system and briefly reviews the challenges faced by science and governance.},

Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context.

	abstract = {Unsustainable fishing simplifies food chains and, as with aquaculture, can result in reliance on a few economically valuable species. This lack of diversity may increase risks of ecological and economic disruptions. Centuries of intense fishing have extirpated most apex predators in the Gulf of Maine (United States and Canada), effectively creating an American lobster (Homarus americanus) monoculture. Over the past 20 years, the economic diversity of marine resources harvested in Maine has declined by almost 70\%. Today, over 80\% of the value of Maine's fish and seafood landings is from highly abundant lobsters. Inflation-corrected income from lobsters in Maine has steadily increased by nearly 400\% since 1985. Fisheries managers, policy makers, and fishers view this as a success. However, such lucrative monocultures increase the social and ecological consequences of future declines in lobsters. In southern New England, disease and stresses related to increases in ocean temperature resulted in more than a 70\% decline in lobster abundance, prompting managers to propose closing that fishery. A similar collapse in Maine could fundamentally disrupt the social and economic foundation of its coast. We suggest the current success of Maine's lobster fishery is a gilded trap. Gilded traps are a type of social trap in which collective actions resulting from economically attractive opportunities outweigh concerns over associated social and ecological risks or consequences. Large financial gain creates a strong reinforcing feedback that deepens the trap. Avoiding or escaping gilded traps requires managing for increased biological and economic diversity. This is difficult to do prior to a crisis while financial incentives for maintaining the status quo are large. The long-term challenge is to shift fisheries management away from single species toward integrated social-ecological approaches that diversify local ecosystems, societies, and economies},
	notes = {() Argues that the Maine lobster fishery is a gilded trap, an attractive economic path that leads to a fragile, but lucarative position. Built on the idea of social traps, where a society gets started in a particular direction, whose end point is unpleasant or lethal, but short term incentives shunt them forwards anyways. Lobsters are profitable, and the Gulf of Maine has essentially been reduced to a lobster monoculture with the removal (via overfishing) of other large fish predators. 
Authors argue that the population needs to diversify so as not to be so utterly dependent on lobsters, and also that high densities put lobsters at risk of disease.
Press for integrated social-ecological approaches. But not sure what they mean by that. Think it's that letting local communities innovate Maybe it means integrating measures of ecological and economic diversity to avoid risk.
Goal of paper was to identify gilded trap and hopes that it will help to stimulate further discussion.(905) (906) () Acheson 2003: local innovations + local compliance leads to stronger conservation ethic. Maybe what I'm thinking about with local ties make stronger investements in resources?

I wonder if I could use fisheries data and management changes that have already taken place, and see how people have changed their behavior. Maybe being able to quantify the feedbacks? Thinking about Maine lobster harvesting, for some reason...(249) Maybe an example of SES modeling in the lobster fisheries?(222) This is what I'm most interested in.(256) Nice to hear.(220) The thing I'm most interested in(256) (247) Something to look into.(221) I think this is true, but also it seems like there's very little characterization/description of how a SES is actually structured. What are the feedbacks between human and ecological components of the system? How do resource distributions determine harvesting patterns, how do harvesting patterns determine ecological patterns. And what external forces modify these patterns, and how does that feed back onto the ecological-human connection.
I think this is slightly different than what they're thinking about. I'm thinking about, for example fishing, climate and fish communities. There's some dynamic set up between fishing and fish communities. When climate changes it changes the fish communities (and possibly the fishing) and that modifies the relationship between fish and fishing. Maybe the stock drops, maybe the distribution of the fish change, maybe it allows a competitor of the fish to explode, etc.. So I'm interesting in just characterizing those relationships, even before we start changing management and resource harvesting incentives...(231) (239) Sounds pretty cool.() SES models are a promising way to cope with:(256) K, so this is the next thing to do for SES modeling.(220) Also what I'm most interested in.(256) Hmm, worth reading to see about. Would think that SES could provide the multiple changes down the road. Give people a clear look at their options based on whatever decision they made now.(223) (247) Good to read more on this.(225) Good to see some examples(257) Maybe worth looking at for the empirical angle.(247) Seems exactly like what I want to do(246) seems like MSE is important, maybe a good paper to read detailing recent work?(245) Seems what Kai wanted evidence of. Maybe worth checking out. Also could connect to trying to parameterize human feedbacks to changes in resource?(246) the feedback i'm interested in. i guess i was thrown off by the 'evolution'(238) Another example possible of human feedbacks in fisheries.(256) K, should read these sources. See the examples they provide. This is what I want to do with whatever models I use. Supports my idea that I could use fisheries data and management changes. Perhaps trying to verify what should have happened with some fieldwork? (which might be interviewssigh).(245) Also having to do with human feedbacks.}

	abstract = {Marine reserves are increasingly recognized as having linked social and ecological dynamics. This study investigates how the ecological performance of 56 marine reserves throughout the Philippines, Caribbean, and Western Indian Ocean (WIO) is related to both reserve design features and the socioeconomic characteristics in associated coastal communities. Ecological performance was measured as fish biomass in the reserve relative to nearby areas. Of the socioeconomic variables considered, human population density and compliance with reserve rules had the strongest effects on fish biomass, but the effects of these variables were region specific. Relationships between population density and the reserve effect on fish biomass were negative in the Caribbean, positive in the WIO, and not detectable in the Philippines. Differing associations between population density and reserve effectiveness defy simple explanation but may depend on human migration to effective reserves, depletion of fish stocks outside reserves, or other social factors that change with population density. Higher levels of compliance reported by resource users was related to higher fish biomass in reserves compared with outside, but this relationship was only statistically significant in the Caribbean. A heuristic model based on correlations between social, cultural, political, economic, and other contextual conditions in 127 marine reserves showed that high levels of compliance with reserve rules were related to complex social interactions rather than simply to enforcement of reserve rules. Comparative research of this type is important for uncovering the complexities surrounding human dimensions of marine reserves and improving reserve management}

Despite widespread human reliance on wildlife for food, the impact of wildlife depletion on human health remains poorly understood. Here we studied a prospective longitudinal cohort of 77 preadolescent children (under 12 y of age) in rural northeastern Madagascar and show that consuming more wildlife was associated with significantly higher hemoglobin concentrations. Our empirical models demonstrate that removing access to wildlife would induce a 29\% increase in the numbers of children suffering from anemia and a tripling of anemia cases among children in the poorest households. The well-known progression from anemia to future disease demonstrates the powerful and far-reaching effects of lost wildlife access on a variety of human health outcomes, including cognitive, motor, and physical deficits. Loss of access to wildlife could arise either from the diligent enforcement of existing conservation policy or from unbridled unsustainable harvest, leading to depletion. Conservation enforcement would enact a more rapid restriction of resources, but self-depletion would potentially lead, albeit more slowly, both to irrevocable local wildlife extinctions and loss of the harvested resource. Our research quantifies costs of reduced access to wildlife for a rural community in Madagascar and illuminates pathways that may broadly link reduced natural resource access to declines in childhood health}

	abstract = {The harvest of wildlife for human consumption is valued at several billion dollars annually and provides an essential source of meat for hundreds of millions of rural people living in poverty. This harvest is also considered among the greatest threats to biodiversity throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Economic development is often proposed as an essential first step to win-win solutions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation by breaking rural reliance on wildlife. However, increases in wealth may accelerate consumption and extend the scale and efficiency of wildlife harvest. Our ability to assess the likelihood of these two contrasting outcomes and to design approaches that simultaneously consider poverty and biodiversity loss is impeded by a weak understanding of the direction and shape of their interaction. Here, we present results of economic and wildlife use surveys conducted in 2,000 households from 96 settlements in Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania, and Madagascar. We examine the individual and interactive roles of wealth, relative food prices, market access, and opportunity costs of time spent hunting on household rates of wildlife consumption. Despite great differences in biogeographic, social, and economic aspects of our study sites, we found a consistent relationship between wealth and wildlife consumption. Wealthier households consume more bushmeat in settlements nearer urban areas, but the opposite pattern is observed in more isolated settlements. Wildlife hunting and consumption increase when alternative livelihoods collapse, but this safety net is an option only for those people living near harvestable wildlife},

	notes = {() Describes the path Ostrom took to come to her conclusions about polycentric governance for managing common-pool resources. Starts out with an explanation of state of knowledge in the mid-20th century: two organization forms ("the market," "the state"), two types of goods (public and private), and individuals assumed to be rational. Through work in irrigation and forest management in Nepal added the concept of 'common pool resource' and discredited the idea that multiple private and public entities were not chaotic, but productive. Introduced the idea of polycentricity (many centers of decision making that are formally independent from one another). 
The framework describes external variables acting on an 'action situation' which intern results in interactions, outcomes and evaluation. External variables can be biophysical conditions, attributes of a community or rules. 
A fundamental shift came when Ostrom suggested that individuals within a social dilemma could affect the external variables themselves without the necessary intervention of 'the state.' Previous work had assumed that individuals in a social dilemma were trapped and required external actors (the government) to step in and change the external variables (by creating policies/laws).}

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES},

	abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25\% of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries},

	abstract = {With the overexploitation of many conventional fish stocks, and growing interest in harvesting new kinds of food from the sea, there is increasing need for managers of fisheries to take account of interactions among species. In particular, as Antarctic krill-fishing industries grow, there is a need to agree upon sound principles for managing the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Using simple models, we discuss the way multispecies food webs respond to the harvesting of species at different trophic levels. These biological and economic insights are applied to a discussion of fisheries in the Southern Ocean and the North Sea and to enunciate some general principles for harvesting in multispecies systems.},

[55]() As conventional prey species are depleted, theres an increasing interest in harvesting unconventional stocks. However these novel species are often lower on the food chain and the prey of the traditionally harvested fish. Antarctic krill exemplify the problem: whaling has reduced baleen whales to around one-sixth of their pristine biomass, resulting in a surplus of Antarctic krill. Theres a great deal of discussion about exploiting this surplus krill, but that krill is the prey of whales, seals, seabirds, penguins, fish and cephalopods, and so there is a concern that intense harvest of krill could cause rippling change throughout the species that depend on them as a food source.  
Other examples of interactions among species come from the North Sea herring and mackerel fisheries. In the 1970s the catch of herring and mackerel have declined, but biomass landed as remained roughly constant, probably because the population of large gadoids[cod, hakes, relatives] and other smaller fish have increased. The decline in herring and mackerel likely result in less predation on, and improved survival of, larval and juvenile stages of other fish species. Other examples that involve different trophic levels include krill, squid, and sperm whales; gray seals and fish; seals, whales and fish that eat herring in the Bering Sea; harp seals, cod, and capelin; cod that eat herring and sprat in the Baltic; and otters and abalone off California.  
Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is a useful metric for discussion management principles. Despite its shortcomings, MSY has the twin benefits of focussing discussion on long-term management for sustainable yields and of indicating a level of exploitation that cannot be exceeded without depleting the stock. But the solution is not applying MSY to each species individually: what if baleen whales kept Antarctic krill below its MSY level in the pristine system? So the question remains what principles should be espoused to manage a multispecies fishery? This article attempts to provide some answers.  
The authors use some simple, heuristic models for the harvesting of interacting populations. Because the authors are especially interested in the management of the Southern Ocean, the models are cast as highly simplified metaphors for major elements of the Antarctic system. First the authors consider the simultaneous harvesting of prey and predator in a two species  system (krill-baleen whales); second, the harvesting of the prey along with one of two predator species (krill-whales-seals); and third, the harvesting of bottom and top species in a system with three trophic levels (krill-cephalopods-sperm whales).  
Simultaneous harvesting of prey and predator in a two species  system (krill-baleen whales): The model considers a krill population (prey, N1) that sustains a baleen whale (predator, N2) population. The model that describes the prey populations is:   
Where r1 is the intrinsic per capita growth rate at low population densities, and resource limitations slow population growth (in logistic fashion) to zero at N1 = K in the absence of predation. A basic Lotka-Volterra form of predation is assumed, with prey being consumed at a rate proportional to their density, aN1, per predator. The dynamics of a predator population are described by: 
 
Where r2 is the intrinsic per capita growth rate at low population densities, and the carrying capacity is directly related to the prey abundance by the proportionality constant $\alpha$.  
Now suppose that the krill population is harvested under a constant effort strategy, at a rate of r1F1; F1 represent the constant fishing effort rescales so F1 = 1 corresponds to the krills intrinsic population growth r1. The consequent yield Y1 is conventionally assumed to be linearly proportional to this fishing effort times stock density, Nt. So in some appropriate units, we can write Y1 = r1F1N1. Harvesting the krill thus then adds an additional mortality term to the right side of the prey equation 
 
Similarly, harvesting whale populations under constant effort at a rate r2F2, adds an extra mortality term to the right hand side of the predator equation.  
 
Rewriting the population variables N1 and N2 in an appropriate dimensionless form, in order to highlight the combination of variables that are key to the behavior of the system results in X1 = N1/K and X2 = N2/$\alpha$K, and including the effects of harvesting the models are rewritten as

Review of responses to harvesting in more complicated ecosystems 
Actualities of harvesting krill in the Southern Ocean and the management of North Sea fisheries are considered in light of these models. In the real world, management for sustained biological yield is usually clouded by economic considerations, which tend to discount future yields; some explicitly multispecies aspects of these economic complications are discussed 
Summarize tentative recommendations for the management of multispecies systems.(270) Balance between increasing mortality of upper-trophic level species but also increasing growth/reproduction because increased food in the system(270) This is probably already done for systems where multiple species are harvested (in fact I know I read about in Alaska). So not sure what next advances could be. If that hadn't been done, would be interesting to combine single species management into multi-species and look to see how management plans have fared insofar as quota setting is concerned.}
