\maketitle
\noindent The goal of this paper is to be a repository for all notes and papers that show evidence for the fact that how harvesting is allocated overs space affects the ecological dynamics of fish populations (either targeted or not).

\section{Introduction}
Most fisheries models make a mean-field assumption, only that how much fish are caught matters, and where they fish are taken from is not important. Here I would like to collective evidence that the spatial allocation of catch does matter. Ideally this will provide a set of examples in which spatial allocation of catch matters, and provide material for me to make hypotheses about in what systems the spatial allocation is likely to be important. With those hypotheses I can examine systems that do and don't match the characteristics and determine if they spatial characteristics do and don't match as I would expect. 

Ideally at some point this could take the form of a meta-analysis, but at this point it's a pilot review to see what type of evidence is out there and in what forms.
