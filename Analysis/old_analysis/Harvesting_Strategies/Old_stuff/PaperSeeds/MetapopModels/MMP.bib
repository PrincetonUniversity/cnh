	abstract = {Use of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as an index of abundance relies on a range of assumptions that are often not met. Variation in habitat is likely to affect catch rates of species and consequently should be taken into account when estimating abundance from \{CPUE\} data, yet this is not generally possible due to a lack of spatially detailed habitat information. Mediterranean artisanal fisheries often operate in coastal areas where habitat is patchy, and consequently catches may not be related to effort if a portion of the gear has been set over unsuitable habitats for the target species. We investigate the effect of habitat patchiness on \{CPUE\} using bottom long-line by including detailed habitat and bathymetric information in the calculation of \{CPUE\} for eight commonly caught species. Comparison of \{CPUE\} estimated with and without taking into account habitat information showed exclusion of hooks in unfavourable habitats generally increases \{CPUE\} estimates for species of restricted mobility and strict habitat associations, while estimates for more mobile species, or those with lower habitat specificity, differ less. We also compare two methods for calculating habitat fished by each hook, one that used the habitat at the hook location, and another that included habitats within a 200\&\#xa0;m radius. The former method had the highest effect on CPUE. Results demonstrate habitat information can be usefully incorporated into \{CPUE\} estimates, while the effect on \{CPUE\} will vary depending on how specific specieshabitat preferences are.}

	abstract = {Functional forms of predator-prey interactions are developed for predators optimally foraging on prey distributed in patches. The model uses mean free-path-length theory to develop functional forms for two idealized behaviors of prey in patches. For congregating prey that maintain a fixed density, for example, fish schools, the predation rate has a ratio-dependent form, and predator interference depends only on predator density. For sessile prey, which maintain a fixed patch size, a new predator-dependent form emerges in which predator interference depends on both prey and predator densities. The Beddington-DeAngelis equation is a special case of the sessile form. The model provides behavioral and biological criteria with which to select the functional form and ranges of coefficients appropriate for a particular food web. Finally, the model illustrates that behavior is an essential factor in predator-prey dynamics}

	abstract = {This article studies the effects of adaptive changes in predator and/or prey activities on the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey population dynamics. The model assumes the classical foraging-predation risk trade-offs: increased activity increases population growth rate, but it also increases mortality rate. The model considers three scenarios: prey only are adaptive, predators only are adaptive, and both species are adaptive. Under all these scenarios, the neutral stability of the classical Lotka-Volterra model is partially lost because the amplitude of maximum oscillation in species numbers is bounded, and the bound is independent of the initial population numbers. Moreover, if both prey and predators behave adaptively, the neutral stability can be completely lost, and a globally stable equilibrium would appear. This is because prey and/or predator switching leads to a piecewise constant prey (predator) isocline with a vertical (horizontal) part that limits the amplitude of oscillations in prey and predator numbers, exactly as suggested by Rosenzweig and MacArthur in their seminal work on graphical stability analysis of predator-prey systems. Prey and predator activities in a long-term run are calculated explicitly. This article shows that predictions based on short-term behavioral experiments may not correspond to long-term predictions when population dynamics are considered},

	abstract = {1. Ideal-free distribution theory assumes that in a patchy environment foragers maximize fitness and hence their feeding rate by balancing gains from more food against losses from more competition. Ultimately, individuals cannot increase their feeding rate by moving to another patch and they distribute themselves over patches in proportion to prey density per patch. 2. In our experiments with shore crabs Carcinus maenas foraging on two adjacent patches with mussels Mytilus edulis, the implicit assumption of ideal-free distribution theory that catch should match time spent in a prey patch is not met, however. Despite aggregating their attack where it is most profitable shore crabs distributed themselves homogeneously across mussel patches: they 'take away' the prey caught and consume it elsewhere to reduce interference. 3. Thus, predator distributions can be quite different from prey-attack distributions. This is important because the latter is shown to be decisive for persistence of predator and prey populations in ecological models},

	abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the stabilizing role that predator dispersal and aggregation have in the top-down regulation of predator-prey systems in a heterogeneous environment. We consider an environment consisting of sites interconnected by dispersal, and propose a novel mechanism of stabilization for the case with a non-sigmoid functional response of predators. We assume that the carrying capacity of the prey is infinitely large in each site, and show that successful top-down regulation of this otherwise globally unstable system is made possible through an interplay between the unevenness of prey fitness across the sites and the rapid food-dependent migration of predators. We argue that this mechanism of stabilization is different from those previously reported in the literature: in particular, it requires a high degree of synchronicity in local oscillations of species densities across the sites. Prey outbreaks take place synchronously, but the unevenness of prey growth rates across the sites results in a pronounced difference in the species densities, and so the predator quickly disperses to the sites with the highest prey abundances. For this reason, the consumption of prey mostly takes place in the sites with high densities of prey, which assures an efficient suppression of outbreaks. Furthermore, when the total size of prey population is low, the distribution of both species among the sites becomes more even, and this prevents overconsumption of the prey by the predator. Finally, we put forward the hypothesis that this mechanism, when considered in a tri-trophic plankton community in the water column, can explain the stability of the nutrient-rich low-chlorophyll open ocean regions},

Look at how predator preferences for different prey types alters the dynamics of a predator-prey system where the predator has positive frequency-dependent predation. Assume that the predator adaptively adjusts a trait that determines the relative capture rates of the two prey species. Find that the predator always lags behind the trait level which would produce the optimal consumption rate based on the current abundance of each prey type.

These conjectures are explored using models of two-patch consumer-resource systems with fitness dependent consumer movement and cyclic dynamics in at least one of the patches; neither conjecture applies generally to such systems. Under relatively low heterogeneity, highly accurate and rapid adaptive movement most often increases both the between-patch correlation of density and the variation in the total density of both species compared to a similar system having a low rate of random movement. However, such adaptive movement can decrease between-patch correlation and global population variability when (1) the consumer's movement is moderately sensitive to fitness differences and heterogeneity is relatively low, or (2) one of the patches would be stable in isolation, and the stable patch supports a sufficiently large consumer population. In both cases, the dynamics are typically either a stable equilibrium or a simple anti-phase cycle with low variation in total population size. Under adaptive movement, population variability is often lowest for intermediate levels of heterogeneity, but monotonic increases or decreases with increasing spatial heterogeneity are possible, depending on the fitness sensitivity of movement and how the characteristic that differs between patches affects within-patch stability and population size. High rates of random movement can lead to greater stability than adaptive movement when consumers are very efficient},

	abstract = {Theoretical ecology is largely founded on the principle of mass action, in which uncoordinated populations of predators and prey move in a random and well-mixed fashion across a featureless landscape. The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities. This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator-prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems},
	notes = {(1041) (1041) (1041) (1041) (1041) (1041) (1041) Isn't this the definition of being in a group? If prey-group density was equla to individual density, it would mean that each individual was in a group of 1, i.e. individual. So if you have a group size greater than 1, then don't you automatically fulfill this condition?(1042)}

	abstract = {This article uses simple models to explore the impact of adaptive movement by consumers on the population dynamics of a consumer-resource metacommunity consisting of two identical patches. Consumer-resource interactions within a patch are described by the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, and these dynamics are assumed to be cyclic in the absence of movement. The per capita movement rate from one patch to the other is an increasing function of the difference between the per capita birth minus death rate in the destination patch and that in the currently occupied patch. Several variations on this model are considered. Results show that adaptive movement frequently creates anti-phase cycles in the two patches; these suppress the predator-prey cycle and lead to low temporal variation of the total population sizes of both species. Paradoxically, even when movement is very sensitive to the fitness difference between patches, perfect synchrony of patches is often much less likely than in comparable systems with random movement. Under these circumstances adaptive movement of consumers often generates differences in the average properties of the two patches. In addition, mean global densities and responses to global perturbations often differ greatly from similar systems with no movement or random movement},
	notes = {(105) This is useful. I think that the local-movement rule seems the most intuitive. Maybe fishermen don't know what's going on at the other patch, but this one is pretty bad.. THis gives me the opportunity to implement some sort of replicator dynamics. To the Appendix!(106) (100) (106) (100) These sources might be good for other options on movement function(106) (100) Again, this is what I'm using for my own model() Looks at movement rules on a 2-patch predator-prey system. Looks at how sensitive system dynamics are to how fast predators move depending on differences between patches.(100) What's happening in this present study.(100) These are the assumptions I'm importing for my version of the patch model.}

	abstract = {Many ecologists believe that there is a lack of foraging theory that works in community contexts, for populations of unique individuals each making trade-offs between food and risk that are subject to feedbacks from behavior of others. Such theory is necessary to reproduce the trait-mediated trophic interactions now recognized as widespread and strong. Game theory can address feedbacks but does not provide foraging theory for unique individuals in variable environments. 'State- and prediction-based theory' (SPT) is a new approach that combines existing trade-off methods with routine updating: individuals regularly predict future food availability and risk from current conditions to optimize a fitness measure. SPT can reproduce a variety of realistic foraging behaviors and trait-mediated trophic interactions with feedbacks, even when the environment is unpredictable},
