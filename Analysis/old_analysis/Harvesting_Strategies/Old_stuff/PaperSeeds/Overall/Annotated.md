# MPAs

## Papers to read first
@SanchiricoWilen2001a
  ~ Metapopulation model with explicit harvesting model with fishermen choice. Simulate reserve creation and examine different types of ecological dispersal processes which create an increase in harvest and aggregate biomass

@SmithWilen2003
  ~ Model spatial closures and show how assuming that harvesting preference is uniform across space can bias estimates of MPA efficacy
  ~ **Significance**: this is what I wanted to do. But also may provide more evidence that this assumption is problematic. 

@WilenBotsford2005
  ~ Sea Grant overview of grant. Interested to see how they set up their sea urchin project and what questions they were interested in asking. What data they collected, etc.

@Hilbornetal2004
  ~ Larval seeding can help fisheries
  ~ MPAs that protect spawning aggregations will allow more individuals to spawn which increases the output off ofspring

@Hart2006
  ~ Conditions under which MPAs can benefit adjacent fisheries

@HastingsBotsford1999
  ~ Determine under what conditions should MPAs provide equivalent yields to fishermen. Modeling approach. 

## Treatment effect of MPAs
@Babcocketal2010
  ~ Treatment effect of MPAs on species interactions

@Lesteretal2009
  ~ Meta-analysis of treatment effect of MPAs. Not sure how it differs than @Halpern2003. Also referenced as conclusive evidence that MPAs improve marine ecosystems.

@Grizzleetal2009
  ~ Treatment effect of MPA on western Gulf of Maine for benthic communities

@Michelietal2004
  ~ Treatment effect of no-take MPAs

@Halpern2003
  ~ Meta-analysis of treatment effect of MPAs, often cited as conclusive evidence that MPAs improve marine ecosystems

@Dinmoreetal2003
  ~ Treatment effect of MPA on benthic communities

## Larval Export and MPAs
@Gainesetal2010
  ~ Larval export should benefit fisheries

@Gainesetal2010a
  ~ Larval export should benefit fisheries

@HofmannGaines2008
  ~ Laval export should benefit fisheries

@Francisetal2007
  ~ Why protecting fish can provide a source population just due to age structure: Fish that are larger and older tend to produce significantly more eggs and a higher proportion of them tend to survive. 

@Murawskietal2000
  ~ MPAs that protect spawning aggregations will allow more individuals to spawn which increases the output off ofspring

### Evidence of Larval Export
@Christieetal2010
  ~ Genetic analyses found yellow tang settled up to 184 km away from MPA
  ~ **Significance** evidence of larval export from MPAs

@Almanyeatl2007
  ~ Chemical tags show that approximately 60% of clownfish return to MPA where they were spawned 
  ~ **Significance** evidence for larval export

## Adult Spillover and MPAs
@JanuchowskiHartleyetal2012
  ~  Evidence for spillover of fish from MPA

@McClanahanKaundaArara1996
  ~ Tagging studies shown that adult fish swim from inside to outside an MPA

## MPAs and Fishermen
@Dawetal2011
  ~ How socio-economic variables correlate with treatment effect of MPAs

@Pollnacetal2010
  ~ MPAs are linked social-ecological systems

@Dawetal2010
  ~ How do MPAs affect fishers

@Smithetal2008
  ~ Evidence that closing fishing to protect spawning season would be worse after accounting for fishermen behavior. 
  ~ **Significance** Accounting for fishermen behavior gives different answer

@Vermardetal2008
  ~ Describe and forecast how Bay of Biscay pelagic fleet will change spatial pattern after closure of anchovy fishery. 
  ~ **Significance** Both considers spatial distribution of effort with RUM and fishery closure.

@SethiHilborn2008
  ~ Model Black rockfish population under MPA and allow poaching. Show that poaching important to consider

@Sanchiricoetal2006
  ~ Fishing displacement may cause social and economic cost
  ~ **Significance** costs fishermen pay when an MPA set up

@Rijnsdorpetal2001
  ~ Fishing displacement may cause social and economic cost
  ~ **Significance** costs fishermen pay when an MPA set up

## Metapopulation models of harvest
@SanchiricoWilen1999
  ~ Metapopulation model of fishermen with varying biological connectivity between patches. Find that equilibrium patterns of biomass across patches is dependent on bioeconomic conditions within each patch and biological dispersal mechansims. 

@SanchiricoWilen2001
  ~ Possibly the same paper as above. 

@Smithetal2007
  ~ Overview of different approaches to spatial harvesting. Illustrate that it's possible to abstract biological and economic parameters of linked spatial-dynamic systems from only economic data
  ~ **Significance** Interested to see if I could do the same on NOAA data. 

## Biological conditions for MPA success
@Grussetal2011
  ~ Home range of species intended to be protected by an MPA important. 
  ~ **Significance** conditions for larval export to benefit fisheries

@Loweetal2003
  ~ Home range of species intended to be protected by an MPA important. **Significance** conditions for larval export to benefit fisheries

## MPAs as an insurance policy
@NationalResearchCouncil2001
  ~ MPAs provide an insurance policy especially when fish are fished extensively and stock assessments are uncertain

## Conditions for MPAs to benefit adjacent fisherires
@Hart2006
  ~ Conditions under which MPAs can benefit adjacent fisheries

@HastingsBotsford1999
  ~ Determine under what conditions should MPAs provide equivalent yields to fishermen. Modeling approach. 

@MoellerNeubert2012
  ~ Put forward that habitat quality is important when considering spatial protection. So increased fishing adjacent to the reserve can damage habitat. Considering habitat degradation and MPAs shows conditions under which MPAs can be successful. 

## Goals for MPAs
@Cinneretal2009
  ~ MPAs might protect coral reefs from human development

@McClanahanetal2006
  ~ Comparing goals for MPAs and successes

@GellRoberts2003
  ~ Propose that MPAs could be solution to overfishing

# Spatial Distribution of fishermen effort
@Daw2008
  ~ Case study of spatial distribution based on interviews in Nicaragua

@EalesWilen1986
  ~ Data for 17 commercial vessels making 300 net sets over season and fit a simple logit model to determine whether recent information on success aids in explaining location choice. 

## Fishermen behavior
@Wilenetal2002
  ~ California Urchin example of linking fishermen model to biophysical model. Important for fully understanding dynamics. 

@Wilen1979
  ~ Paper about the importance of understanding fishermen behavior for effecient regulation.
