# There's a github desktop application that you can download, or do it from the command line. The desktop application should be fairly intuitive you need to "add" and "commit" the new changes locally and then "push" to the repo (I think it might be "sync" on the desktop application.
# 
# From the command line you'd cd to get to the directory where your github repo. In there you'd type git add <filename> to add each file you'd like to sync. Then after all those files are run (you can run git status to see) type git commit  -m "commit message here" that saves the changes locally. Then to push to the repo you need to do two things: 1) make sure you have your local repo up to date and 2) then push new changes up to the repository. Those commands are git pull origin master and git push origin master respectively.
