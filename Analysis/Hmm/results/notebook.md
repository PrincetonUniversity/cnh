## Nonlinear forecasting
Author: Emma Fuller
Date: 2014-04-24

`nl-forecast.R` is a script written by colin twomey to test out Sugihara's nonlinear forecasting methods. Colin is interested in applying this to fish, specifically seeing when things like speed are not predicted by previous states, and thus presumably affected by external stimuli. This would be cool do to for fishermen as well. If I could identify changes in behavior that are not predicted by some scale of autocorrelation (could be short or very long term), then could either indicate novel information from the environment, or social information. I haven't started on this, but the code is here to check out. 

Added a single trajectory. Idea was to predict speed. Haven't figured out how to do that yet.
