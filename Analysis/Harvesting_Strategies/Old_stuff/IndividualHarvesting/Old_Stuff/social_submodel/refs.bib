Finds that the predictions of a yield-effort relationship are different from general production fishery models
Discusses management implications of these different relationships.() Just illustrating that density estimates are sensitive to assumptions in CPUE. So only addresses ecology and how that affects fishing behavior. Not so much on technology or social.}
