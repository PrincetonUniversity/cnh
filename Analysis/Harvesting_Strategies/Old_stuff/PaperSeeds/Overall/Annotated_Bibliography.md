## MPAs
What is most current about MPAs?

### Do MPAs work? 
Are they context dependent in any way (depends on the species targeted, type of habitat (coral reef or temperate), what the goals are)? How is 'success' measured? Is there differences in success rate between MPAs that focus on conservation goals versus fishery goals? What are the common goals? How do people choose where MPAs go? How to fishermen respond to MPAs being set up and how are they included in the planning process? Ideal to know if fishing outside the reserve is taken into account. 

##### [NOAA fact sheet about MPAs](http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/do_no_take_reserves_benefit_adjacent_fisheries.pdf)

Results of MPAs

+ Organisms within MPAS grow larger and live longer than individuals from adjacent unprotected areas.
	+ Monitoring 89 no-take marine reserves around the world have shown on average that fish density, biomass, size, and diversity all increased within marine reserves [@Halperne2003 @Lesteretal2009]
	+ This is important because fish that are larger and older tend to produce significantly more eggs and a higher proportion of them tend to survive (Francis et al. 2007)

Useful for fisheries through either adult spillover or larval export or insurance. 

+ Larval export should benefit fisheries (Hofmann and Gaines 2008, [@Gainesetal2010 @Gainesetal2010a]
+ Tagging studies have shown that some fish species swim from inside the MPAs to adjacent fished areas (McClanahan & Kaunda-Arara 1996, Lowe et al. 2003)
+ Larval seeding can happen with increased eggs and larvae from within marine reserves @Hilbornetal2004
+ The reserve must export enough larvae and adult organisms to at least make up for the increased impacts of the displaced fishing in areas remaining open @Hilbornetal2004
+ Benefits will only accrue if the spillover of eggs and larvae are greater than before its closure (Hart 2006). 
+ MPAs that protect spawning aggregations will allow more individuals to spawn increasing the output of offspring (Murawski et al. 2000 @Hilbornetal2004).
+ Eliminating bottom fishing tends to protect habitat (Auster et al. 1996) which can contribute to improved fishery spawning, feeding and refuge opportunities as well. 
+ MPAs create an "insurance policy" against natural and anthropogenic disturbances that impact fisheries as well as inaccuracies in fish stock assessments and data poor situations. The National Research Council (2001) concluded that "marine reserves may provide the only effective means to ensure against overfishing of some species if exploitation is high and there is substantial uncertainty in stock assessments"

Conditions need to be present for MPAs to be useful for fishermen

+ Species that are sessile are unlikely to move into adjacent fished areas (although larvae could potentially seed distant areas)
+ If species move long distances none of them will remain in the MPA, so the MPA can offer little protection. 
+ "Home Range" (distance the species routinely travels from a particular area) is important when setting up an MPA designed to protect it (Lowe 2003, Gr√ºs 2011). 
+ Objections to MPAs have been often based on lack of direct evidence that MPAS successfully seed adjacent areas with eggs and larvae of targeted species (Christie et al. 2010). 
+ Difficult to track settlement and recruitment and is also due to currents and temperatures. Examples of studies that have successfully tracked recruitment are 
	+ Christie et al 2010: Genetic analyses found yellow tang settled up to 184 km away from MPA
	+ Almany et al. 2007: Chemical tags used to on clownfish found that 60% of young individuals returned to the MPA where they were spawned

Response of fishermen 

+ Eliminating fishing from an area causes fishermen to move to different areas, potentially concentrating fishing in smaller areas and adding to the stressors in those sites. Unknown if this could cause overfishing and habitat destruction in the adjacent fished areas. 
+ Fishing displacement might also cause social anxiety and moving to new areas may cause significant economic costs or fishing in areas that are less productive (Rijnsdorp et al. 2001). Coastal communities located next to the no fishing area may be negatively impacted, socially and economically as well (Sanchirico et al. 2006).

### Spatial predator-prey work: theoretical
 How is space predicted to control stability of predator-prey models? What are the conditions for stability or instability in spatial-predator prey models. And how is that different from what's expected if there's no spatial structure? Are their connections between predictions for stability in theoretical models and fishermen scenarios?

### How do fishermen distribute their effort in space
 Do fishermen array themselves non-randomly in space. Are there general reviews of how fishermen array themselves in space or just case studies? Are there generalities to be pulled out?
