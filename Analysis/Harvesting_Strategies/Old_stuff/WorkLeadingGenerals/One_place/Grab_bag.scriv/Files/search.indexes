            <Text>Project unrelated: Artisnal versus commercial fisheries
Current assumptions have been for US commercial fisheries. Artisinal fisheries have a set of unique constraints. Their processing is minimal, holds are low, and fiat currency are not always so available to trade for fish. Further the ecology of the fish are unique (coral based?) and the top-down management less stringent (or nonexistant). The question is, how does this change harvesting strategy?

Given artisanal fisheries have their own unique set of constraints that differ greatly from commercial fisheries. This is most obviously true in terms of gear, but the market itself may impose more substaintail constrants causing harvesting strategies to differ. </Text>

            <Text>Large interest
is to understand how human resource use affects ecosystems, which can, in turn, affect human communities that depend on those resources. Motivations for this are that I want to help prevent management surprises (change in the way resources are managed has indirect and unpredicted result), and to be clear about trade-offs. 

Much of conservation seems to be about aligning incentives, if we can get resource-users and society's values in line, then we can have win-wins. And this is sometimes true. The MSC operates on the idea that fishermen should sustainably manage their catches, and people will pay more for that brand. Increase transparency for the consumers, and fishermen are rewarded with higher profits. But I think sometimes it's just not possible to align both fishermen and society's incentives. But often it seems like conservation attempts are considered failures because they failed to align incentives. But what if you can't? I want to be clear about tradeoffs, when such tradeoffs need to be made. Then you can have a discussion about values, what are the costs and benefits to such actions, to whom? That's not a question for science. 

This might be a good thing to talk to Wilcove about, what is the process for identifying conservation opportunities. Is the process I'm describing done anywhere?

The question for science is, what are the possible range of parameters that can be altered by policies. There's a discrete set of parameters that managers can change for fishermen (where/when they harvest, how much). But they can't micro-manage them (I think for both ethical and financial reasons -- it'd be too expensive). Further I dislike the focus on panaceas. First it's payment for ecosystem services, then it's community based management, etc. I want a more rigorous way of evaluating the system characteristics, figuring out what parameters could be changed by policy and looking at available options. Then figuring out what the likely effect of those changes will be and having a cost/benefit/values conversation  

Erm, what's the second goal?

Medium idea
is to use fishing as a case study of this. The goals are two-fold. First it would be nice to have a model for flexible and responsive fishermen behavior to put in large ecosystem based models. I like the ecosystem based models a lot, and what I want to know is how fishermen change the marine community, the species interactions and indirect changes that occur. But much of the EBMs already exist. The idea is that I could contribute an accurate model of human behavior to be layered on top. 

Fine scale project
is to look at harvesting strategies of fishermen and see if they're a result of the system characteristics I think are most important (ecology, gear, management, information; reputation, profit). The questions are
	1)	Are there evolutionarily stable strategies in fishermen, and do those depend on the ecology, technology, gear and information available to actors.
	⁃	What does my theory predict?
	⁃	Should look at big Colin's paper about signaling. How does he figure out the optimal strategy for signally and go from ABM to analytical. Seems like what I want to do here. What are the optimal strategies and how to go from ABM to analytical

First step is thinking about system. Rough ideas: 
	1)	The stochasticity of fish movement will increase value of social information 
	2)	Technology that improves local gradient sensing will decrease the value of social information
	3)	Management that has an open season, just a TAC will increase competition between fishers and reduce information sharing (this is obvious/already known probably). 
	4)	Some readings that might help:
	⁃	[#Kraak:2010;]: Looks at the role of exploiting fishermen behavior (exploit is the wrong word) to get better management, rather than being exclusively top down. Might give some ideas about under what circumstances you'd expect fishermen to cooperate. Could I put it in my framework? 
	⁃	[#Nelsonetal:2005;]: Looks at what human drivers change ecosystem services. From brief glance appears to be mostly terrestrial, but maybe an example of what types of drivers could be expected do change ecosystem services. 
	⁃	[#VanDenBerghetal:2000;]: Paper about the assumptions that economic models require, specifically about whether or not humans optimize. Might be good for thinking about how to model human behavior. Also think this is the paper that `satisfizing' comes from. 
	⁃	[#Kramer:2008;]: Possible model paper. Uses replicator dynamics to look at the evolution of harvesting strategy as a function of profit.  from two trophic levels in a coral reef food web. 
	⁃	[#Horanetal:2011;]: Analytical SES modeling paper from PNAS. Really liked it, should review. 
	⁃	[#Ornes:2013;]: News feature from PNAS, about Lévy walks in marine predator foraging behavior. Lévy walks are characterized by random probabilities in both direction and step length (I think), and look like a series of small brownian motion steps with occasional huge steps between bouts of small scale movement. The news article in PNAS is a review of the argument about whether marine predators exhibit Lévy walks in their searching patterns. But also interesting to see if humans exhibit this type of search behavior when looking for fish. Might be a useful first step to look up some of the work this news article is summarizing. 
	⁃	[#Plaganyietal:2013;]: Big simulation using a MSE framework. But includes social information by looking at how participation within subsectors of a rock lobster fishery will change depending on management. Likely extremely useful in thinking about an SES simulation model. Has examples of social outputs, and have a spatial allocation model. I don't think they did ABM, but they might have. Need to go back into SI methods to see. 
Do these models predict something different than basic bioeconomic modeling (predicting profits, catch variance, ecological impact). Necessitates a review of what's out there, probably trying to do some bioeconomic modeling of what I've looked at with ABM/analytic work and probably focusing on some case studies.
The question is: do bioeconomic models predict evolutionarily stable harvest strategies, start with Colin Clark's book? Also read Mia's latest paper. Additionally this: Towards the optimal management of the northeast ar.pdf looks like a general example of a comprehensive management plan. What problems does this try to solve, what's it missing/can't solve.
When are these models useful?
What are stable strategies good for? So I've identified a stable strategy, it's only interesting to me if it has an effect on the ecosystem. That harvesting in a particular way has a particular type of impact to the marine foodweb. Stuck here, feel like there should be more interesting questions to ask IF the predictions from my modeling are sufficiently different from bioeconomic models, despite there not being ecological effects. Maybe need to read more bioeconomic models to see what type of questions they answer. Also re-read Maja's paper.
What questions can these models answer that other, more basic ones can't.
I think this question should be answered first, and a place to start is the ecosystem service modeling papers I've printed out, and the human behavior fishery review papers: [#Fultonetal:2011;], [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]), including the economic framework pape.
	•	What happens if these theories do not generate sufficiently different predictions than bioeconomic theory? Well then I can say that in SESs, really we don't need complex models about how diverse sets of actors behave.
	•	If there are evolutionarily stable strategies predicted in theory, are those observed in data?  Probably best to start with high resolution data, Sweden/Norway. Then go to West coast that has lower resolution (possibly biasing with catch logs, less observer coverage and VMS data)
	•	Possible addition: comparison between industrial and artisnal fishing fleets. Same species, different harvesting pattern?

Thought experiment
Say I have the ABM up and running. The outputs it gives me include: the amount of fish each fishermen gets, how many fish are left in the water, a measure of effort (catch per unit time? per unit movement?), and parameter values characterizing resource and fishermen. What are the questions I want to ask?

	1.	If we are more explicit about human behavior, can we more precisely define incentives for fishermen and better examine under what conditions society's and fishermen's values can be aligned?
	2.	Using fine scale economic indices (value added, total employment, variance in these metrics) do these differ from bioeconomic predictions of the same system? 
	3.	Current work on how policy incentives influence fishermen behavior and resultant fishery outcomes, how does adding fine scale variation in fishermen behavior change these conclusions. (Sources of existing work in [#Fultonetal:2011;]: Folke et al. 2002; Hilborn et al. 2005; Grafton et al. 2006, 2008; but possibly some problems with the aforementioned refs -- specifically highlighting false assumptions about human behavior: [#DurrenbergerPalsson:1987;]; [#McCayJentoft:1998;]). 
	4.	Can a general model framework be developed to include social information for evaluating management policies?
	5.	Can we characterize the main axes on which marine capture SESs vary from one another (my guess: ecology, technology, information, management), parameterize for each major type, and identify management that would(n't) be appropriate for the system. This involves identifying parameters that management is able to manipulate, and general mechanistic relationships between harvesting strategy and system characteristics. Goal: find mechanistic relationships between behavior and management policy. Possible refs from [#Fultonetal:2011;]: [#Fultonetal:2007;BradyWaldo:2009;]
	6.	Can we explain management surprises by better understanding micro-scale human responses?
	7.	Are there optimal harvesting strategies for given ecological, technological, information sharing parameters? 
	8.	Example of hypotheses/tests generation:
	⁃	Here is a general model of a fishery SES. It is legitimately general because it represents fish like this, people like this, assumptions that have been shown to be fine. 
	⁃	Default is searching on own. What is most efficient asocial search pattern?
	⁃	Next simplest assumption is that you can watch others. Under what conditions (possibly constrained by reality in commercial fisheries) does this strategy become optimal?
	⁃	Next is social network. Under what conditions can you have directed signaling as an ESS?
	⁃	What happens if everyone is in a social network and there and you can't punish
	⁃	What happens if you can punish
	⁃	What happens with different initial shapes of social network
	9.	What happens when you can choose from any 3 options of info, what are required for these 3 possibilities (asocial, observation, social) to become ESS?
	10.	Are these optimal harvesting strategies what fishermen really use?
	11.	Is there a difference in relationship between optimal harvesting strategy and system characteristics when input versus output control is used to manage a fishery?
	12.	If I want to characterize the system from a much higher level, to look at longterm dynamics and drivers. These refs might be more useful model papers: (refs from Fulton et al. 2012) Folke et al. 2002; Walker et al. 2002, Bennett et al. 2003, Ostrom 2009, Gibbs 2009.</Text>

            <Text>Specifically I'm not having any trouble thinking about how to motivate the study of how humans behavior from an applied/management perspective. But I am struggling to see how this is of interest ecologically. One point is that human activities often dominate ecological dynamics and evolutionary processes, so it's important to understand how these human impacts are likely to coevolve with underlying system dynamics.

            <Title>Talking to Ray Hilborn about his work</Title>
            <Text>Questions and comments from Ray Hilborn's latest email
Ray wrote the following:
We are nibbling around this area in a lot of different activities.  We have a NSF CNH grant to look at aspects of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery,  with one aspect modeling the dynamics of permit ownership (they tend to drift out of local communities to larger centers) and participation in the fisheries.

As a follow up to Worm 2009 we are looking at the management factors related to good biological, social and economic outcomes.  I am doing this with a range of co-authors including Mike Melnychuk,  Chris Costello and Corbett Grainger (the last two economists).  What we know from Worm et al 2009 and subsequent deeper analysis is the biggest differences are by region -- for instance EU countries do poorly on biological status, US, New Zealand, and Iceland do well.  Much of this has to do with the governance system --  EU has a highly political process for setting quotas.}

so hypotheses we are testing and suspect are important are
	•	the legal/governance system (or lack of it)
	•	the economics of the fishery -- low value stocks are often at high abundance
	•	the life history especially through vulnerability to by-catch

When we shift to economic and social success some of the same factors seem to apply, especially governance and we are pretty sure that  the nature of harvester rights has a lot to do with economic profitability and impact on communities.

My thoughts and questions:
	1.	Seems like the follow-up study is correlation -- trying to identify which characteristics are associated with biological and social success. Do you have any idea if it would be possible (or again, if you're thinking about it) to look at policy changes and use them as natural experiments to try to think about which characteristics might be more or less important? Is that even possible?
	2.	Still on the follow-up study, what exactly is governance system? All those countries are developed, is it governance related specifically to how fish are managed? Is this related to the Ostrom framework? Using that? Option on that framework?
	3.	Also seems like the characteristics of the resource community are left out (again thinking of the Ostrom framework), Maybe with harvesters rights you're talking about it? But the ability to get into and out of the fishery might matter, how close the community is, the kind of trust/familiarity of everyone? Can people ostracize others?
	4.	For the proposed hypotheses: the economics is that high values are fished much closer to $B_{MSY}$?
	5.	The last hypothesis about vulnerability of life history, an interesting take on Malin's paper. So it's not the fish's vulnerability to being caught, but rather the likelihood of them getting caught and not accounted for? And thus overfished? I like it. 
	6.	I can imagine pretty straightforward metrics for economic success (improve profits, etc.) but how are you guys measuring social success? I imagine community stability  is important (keeping people around, maintaining jobs without a huge amount of fluctuation), but it's not immediately obvious to me how you'd quantify that in a single number. Or even which social processes are most important to track (or what all those social processes could be). 
	⁃	But possibly could be “ensuring a sustainable contribution of fisheries to the economy” as stated in  [#GarciaCharles:2008;]. 
	8.	Also the modeling of permit-holders, how are you doing that? ABM, and they're allowed to sell off their permits? What are the goals of this model? Management suggestions, could you predict how new policy might change the dynamics?
	9.	Also trying to get a feel for what's been done, what's possible to try to frame my own work. So any broad general suggestions are super helpful. Specifically, how to take a model and test its assumptions, make it useful to policy and management. Do you know any examples??

            <Text>Project unrelated: Determining optimal harvesting strategies and backwards ESSs
For a given ecology of fish (and their corresponding distribution) there will be an optimal way to harvest this fish for biological sustainability. The goal is then to back calculate what an ESS would be that matches the biologically optimal harvesting strategy. Determining when an ESS is and isn't possible is key to understanding whether there is truth underlying the platitude that management surprises come from a failure to properly align individual and societal incentives. 

Given age and size structure, should be able to determine an optimal way to harvest such a population. How can you guarantee that the ESS strategy at the level of the individual results in the optimal harvesting strategy for the biological sustainability of the stock?

If you can't, why not?</Text>

            <Text>Previous work/Motivation
Previous work on fisheries has primarily looked at the harvesting behavior of fishermen in two ways: either from a general perspective at a population level, or a case study at the level of the individual.

Population level work has focused on information sharing in fishermen (Mangel &amp; Clark), general observations about how CPUE should interact with fish abundance {Hilborn 1992}. The conclusions of these studies are broadly that something. Case studies have focused on location choice in fishermen (RUM models), descriptive accounts of the anthropology of fishing communities, and others. There are few studies that consider the result of fishing dynamics and fishermen harvesting behavior. The few that do tend to find surprising results. {Smith 2008a} found that policy recommendations reversed entirely when fishermen behavior and ecological dynamics were endogenous to the model. 

There are a few examples of studies that integrate individual level behavior to population level dynamics. {Wilson 2007a} develop a biophysical agent-based-model of the Maine lobster fishery in which both the recruitment and catchability of lobster vary at seasonal and yearly time scales while fisher behavior varies at a daily scale. Fisher decision's are allowed to evolve and respond endogenously to conditions in the simulation, however this results in a decision space for fishermen that consists of approximately 14 trillion different unique choices. The goal of this review is to search for more tractable, simple explanations to link the foraging behavior of fishermen and the biophysical conditions of the marine system.

Despite the focus at two levels, these studies have not been well integrated or connections have not been explained mechanistically. Studies that aggregate individual level variation in harvesting studies either are statistical or do not consider the outcome for stock dynamics. Further these case studies have widely divergent ecologies of targeted species, types of gear and management in place. </Text>

Other examples?
Interesting result of this model is that ABM had fishermen pretty close to an IDF, just like what’s observed in real life. Hilborn talks about how fishermen tend to approximate an IDF, but don’t think he provided a reason why. Or how that comes about. 

Wonder if fishermen do approximate an IDF, what consequences that can have on ecology. Does it matter? Is it more sustainable because fish are harvested relative to proportion that are present? Or maybe it’s not actually abundance but catchability varies. </Comments>

            <Title>Function to switch between patches</Title>
            <Text>Also thinking about my patch model (extension of [#Abramsetal:2012;] model), and how the cost of searching should be modeled within a patch. Nothing yet on what functional form to model for going between patches. But did look at the function that [#Abramsetal:2012;] use and you get this plot here. Which is seriously nonlinear (going up faster than exponential). Not sure why they chose this form. Should revisit the paper to see. Simon thinks maybe logistic or something?

Hardest thing to think about is what the mechanistic underpinning of patch movement might be. It makes sense to me that there's some nonlinear switch. That implies to me that there's some inertia is shifting over. That at some threshold everyone is going to go to the other patch. And that when the patches are basically the same, the switching rate between patches is zero. But what doesn't make sense is that there's some maximum rate. Or really, it also doesn't make sense that the rate keeps going up and up and up either.. 

[#Abramsetal:2011;] has some good background for these types of models and the general findings about population dynamics. Worth digging into to get background on the model I'm layering on top of. 
 
[#Abramsetal:2011;] delivers! Discusses 3 types of movement functions: 

	1.	per capita movement approaches an asymptote at relatively large fitness (``constrained rate movement'') 
	2.	movement rates decrease to zero when the other patch confers equal or lower fitness (“no-error movement'')
	3.	ones in which only fitness in the current patch influences movement (``local fitness'' movement)

Of these, I am drawn first to the local-fitness function. Mechanistically this seems best in that it starts at the simplest level where fishermen don't know what's happening at the other patch. And thus separates out the moving of the fishermen from the moving, plus the information component. 

Additionally, this might allow me to put in some replicator dynamics in. Fishermen are more likely to switch patches if their current catch is lower than the community mean. The implication is that throughout the season, fishermen bring catches back to processing and can evaluate the community mean catch. 

[#Abramsetal:2011;] don't
 provide an equation for the local-fitness dispersal function but refer to [#Ives:1992;]. [#Ives:1992;] looks at how overlapping generations of hosts and parasitoids affect stability conditions (since most host-parasitoid models had discrete generations, apparently). But the dispersal function he gives for the parasitoids is 

#

Where uA is the dispersal rate of parasitoids from patches containing no hosts, and the parameter mA determines how the parasitoid dispersal rate changes in response to host density, hi is the number of hosts in patch i. For mA = 0, the dispersal rate of parasitoids from a patch is independent of the number of hosts in the patch. For mA&gt;0, the dispersal rate of parasitoids decreases as the number of hosts in a patch increases, with larger values of mA corresponding to greater decreases in parasitoid dispersal. So mA is a measure of parasitoid aggregation, since larger values of mA imply that parasitoids remain longer in patches with high host density. 

Actually [#Abramsetal:2011;] do give a functional form, they just take out the Wj term so the dispersal from patch i, so dispersal from patch i to patch j becomes

￼
Where Wi is the fitness of patch i and is defined as
￼

Which is the Holling type II functional response minus the death rate. So it's essentially the growth rate that a single predator would experience in patch i. Thus the minimum value for Mij when there's no prey (Ri = 0) would be Wi=-d and the maximum is when Ri is at its carrying capacity. 

Now the challenge is thinking about how this would apply to fishermen. My idea is that I'm modeling the fraction of fishermen in patch i. And instead of growth and death rates, there's profits and costs. Certainly the fishermen are likely to stay in the patch so long as costs match profit. So perhaps now for fishermen 

￼

Where πi/j is the profit accruing to fishermen in patch i/j. The idea is that if you're doing better than fishermen in patch j, you'll stay in this patch. Thus when profits are equal, you won't switch between the patches, and if you have no profits, fishermen will switch at a rate ƛ. 

But I think this is still exponential. But if I make it without any information from the other patch it could just be 

￼

Where πi is profit from patch i and is
￼

Where pN is the worth in dollars for the predators Ni, fish targeted) and ci is the cost of fishing it in patch i. This means that if price = costs or there are no predators (fish available to harvest) then fishermen will leave the patch at rate m/(1+αm). But even if πi gets negative the rate of leaving the patch is constrained to 1/α.

The problem here is that you get the same behavior if there are no predators as if the costs = prices. I'd imagine that if costs = prices then the fishermen would be happy to sit in the same patch and not switch. But if there are no predators, they're still loosing costs. I guess they're not loosing money from sitting around not catching. So if ci$ is the cost of handling the fish (catching them) then that's fine. But I imagine there's a search cost. So maybe that needs to be added outside as a flat cost that's paid no matter what. So Mij becomes 
￼

Still struggling with this. This appears to still be exponential. It only becomes constrained if you have negative πi which is only possible when costs of handling are greater than the price you get, or that there's negative biomass. So.. not sure. It seems effectively constrained when πi = 0... but not sure.

            <Text>Long-lining
Uses a long line, called the main line, with baited hooks attached at intervals by means of branch lines called snoods or ganglions. A snood is a short length of line, attached to the main line using a clip or swivel, with the hook at the other end. Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. LInes can also be set using an anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. Longliners commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sable fist and many other species. 

In some fisheries fishermen may be limited to as few as 25 hooks per line. In contrast others can run of 2,500 hand baited hooks on a  signal series of connected lines many miles in length.This all comes from Wikipedia

Vessel and handling equipment
Vessels range from open boats, using manual operated longlines, to highly mechanized, specialized vessels equipped with a series of specialized pieces of equipment  for the mechanization of almost al the maneuvers. The most modern longliners have a fully sheltered deck with only a window by the stern for shooting the line and another by the side forward to haul back the line.  

Species targeted, locality if any
Bottom or demersal species, occasionally pelagic. The boats are all over the world, and can be operated from shallow waters to thousands or more meters in depth, on all types of bottoms, including very rough ones. From FAO Fishing gear type website.

            <Text>Effect of adding functional responses to Scheffer model
The Scheffer model with constant effort is 
#
With this equation you can 
	•	Find the equilibrium values (N* = 0, K[1-qE/r])
	•	Calculate the yield (Y) where Y = qEN* or Y = qEK(1-qE/r)
	•	With an equation for Y, we can find the maximum effort (E_msy) because Y is a parabola
	•	With E_msy we can plug it back into the original equation to find out what the biomass will be with maximum sustained yield (MSY), N_msy

The question is, how does the MSY change if you make the harvesting response into a functional response. Does the equilibrium biomass change?

Now if we add in the functional response that assumes that fishermen clump. Marc Mangel suggests the following functional response

￼

But I don’t know what c_max or C0 would be. C_max is the maximum rate a fishermen (the fleet?) can harvest. C0 is how nonlinear the function is. Large values of C0 make the response linear (more fish means more fishing), low values of C0 mean that for some ranges there’s a sharp change in harvest rate with increased fish, but at higher values C(N) is roughly constant. Increasing this value increases the rate at which the function asymptotes. However if you include that at attempt to take the same steps the model becomes

￼

Equilibrium values are N* = 0, and then must solve

Using the quadratic formula

And using Mathematica (I cheated) you get

Review of work looking at predator-prey systems and when space becomes important?</Synopsis>
            <Text>Functional Responses and Predator-Prey Systems in Space

{Gurarie 2013}
	•	Propose a general framework to look at probablistic encounters between arbitrarily moving searchers and immobile targets in continuous space and time. 
	•	Distinguish between first encounter rates and mean encounter rates
	•	Background of null models for encounter rates
	⁃	Most null models are derived from the ideal gas law which assumes perfectly elastic, linearly moving spheres of a fixed radius. 
	⁃	In general these models lead ot the conclusion that encounter rates are proportional to a power of the encounter radius, to the density of particles, and to some combination (for example, root-mean-square) of the movement velocities. 
	⁃	These models typically account for heterogenous populations, since the velocities are drawn from a distribution (for example, the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution), but the movement of individual particles between collisions is assumed to be linear with constant velocity and the encounters themselves are implied to be deterministic collisions between hard spheres.
	•	Background of animal models
	⁃	Animal movements are generally not linear, and so ecologists have typically modeled animal movement as including a random component. 
	⁃	The default assumption is of Brownian-like random movement which lead to diffusion models of dispersal. Diffusion rates have been related to actual movements of animal movements via correlated random walk and continuous correlated movement models, which add realism by including some local directional persistence. 
	⁃	Diffusion models rely on the assumption that the trajectory of each individual population is described with the same parameters for each individual. 
	⁃	Thus there's a tension between diffusion models (which describe homogenous populations of randomly moving individuals) and ideal free gas based models (which assume a heterogeneous population of linearly moving individuals). 
	⁃	This is particularly interesting because diffusion models are the canonical null models of animal dispersal while ideal free gas based models are the null model of encounters in ecology, implicitly underlying the rate parameters in Lotka-Volterra type predator-prey models. 
	⁃	Real moving and interacting organisms are described by a mixture of the two extremes: a heterogeneous population of randomly moving individuals. 
	•	Modeling heterogenous individuals moving randomly
	⁃	Several studies have analytically addressed heterogenous populations in diffusion models, but most studies that expand encounter rate models to randomly moving organisms have been based on simulation. 
	⁃	A recent review concluded that the turning angle distributions, detection distance, step length and step number all have interacting non-linear effects, so quantitative predictions are only possible using simulation. 
	⁃	The few simulation-based (or hybrid analytical and simulation) encounter studies suggest that movements with less direction persistence (more diffusive movements) lead to longer target hitting times, and thus lower encounter rates. 
	⁃	Some analytical approaches do exist, and it's been found that for diffusive movement, the first hitting time (or first passage time) in a heterogenous environment can be obtained as a solution to a partial differential equation. This technique has been applied to animal movements in a statistically described environment and found that one-dimensional encounter rates scale linearly with target density for linear movements but as density squared fro diffusive movements. 
	⁃	This seems related to the fact that variance (displacement) scales linearly with time in ballsitic (linear) movement but scales as variance-squared in diffusive movement
	⁃	Interestingly, for nondestructive foraging, any kind of movement (ballistica, brownian, or Levy) yields the same encounter rate since they depend entirely on density. 
	•	Besides linear movement, the other assumption of ideal free gas models is that encounters are deterministic: they occur as hard collisions of spheres with a fixed encounter radius. But many ecological encounter processes are probabilistic. 
	•	Encounters are discrete events between the search and the targest, the latter of which are distributed with a specific geometry in space and time. 
	•	Propose that the calculations of the encounter rate depend on the definiton of the encounter rate, the characteristics of the movement rate, the geometry of the target distribution, and the interaction between the searcher and the targets. 
	•	Encounter rate definitions:
	⁃	Mean encounter rate: the stationary expected number of encounters in an interval of itme. This is relevant for a "continuous" feeder (a system where handling and processing of food takes much less time than encountering food) or for "passive traps" such as counting, camera or fur traps and ambush predators
	⁃	First encounter rate: the reciprocal of the expected time to first encounter after the search begins its movement from a random location. This is a more relvant quantity to measure in those cases where movements or behaviors are significantly interrupted by an encounter. For example, large terrestrial predators process their prey on a scale of days, during which time the landscape of prey can be significantly reconfigured and the intial location of the predator with respect to the prey can be considered random.
	⁃	Mean and first encounter rates are equal in only a few special cases. 
	•	Target dynamics: targets can be static (constant in time) or their dynamics can be governed by a birth and death process. An example of a static target would be a set of pitfall traps that are kept at fixed locations. A dynamic target is a case where the targets are living organisms which appear and disappear on the landscape continuously (ground squirrels leaving or entering a landscape of burows, seeds being deposited through their productiona nd dispersal and removed via germenation or decomposition. Targets can also be mobile, but only immobile targets are considered here. 
	•	Interactions between searcher and targets: 
	⁃	Many kinds of interactions between searchers and targets are possible. For example, in predator-prey dynamics the searcher (the predator) with a wide perception range may bias its movements towards a target (the prey) from a distance. The prey may decrease its encounter rate by changing its behavior when the predator is close. 
	⁃	To keep things simple, the influence of searcher-target interactions on movement is excluded and consider only the nature of the encounter event itself. 
	⁃	This may not be such a bad assumption. Probably assumed that fish don't know about predation risk by boats (I.e. {Abramsetal:2012}). And while fishing boats will bias their movements towards prey they've detected, could probably assume that it's not from super far distances (unless they've got spotter planes). 
	⁃	There are two kinds of interactions between searcher and targets: destructive interactions in which a target is consumed upon encounter, and non-destructive interactions, where the target remains uninfluenced by the encounter event. 
	⁃	For simplicity consider only the case of a single searcher and ignore the possibility of target depletion by other searchers. 
	⁃	This is quite important, given that this is a big part of thinking about fishermen. 
	⁃	Encounter probability is classified as either "hard": the encounter occurs immediately when a searcher is within a threshold distance from a target, or "soft": here called probabilistic, which occurs at a rate that depends on the distance between the target and the searcher.
	⁃	This might be all I need for fishermen. They have some fish finder and then the encounter probability depends in some way (or is related to) q, catchability. 
	•	Encounter kernals: formalize the definitions into a general mathematical framework of encounters in continuous space and time. The examples are limited to two dimensions, though generalizing to higher dimensions is typically straightforward.

            <Title>Grouping in predators and prey stabilizes — Fryxell</Title>
            <Text>Grouping in predators and prey stabilizes — Fryxell et al. (2007)
Introduced 4 functional responses looking at how grouping of predators and/or prey made a predator-prey system parameterized with lion/wildebeest data more or less stable. Found that groups reduced the prey intake rate of the predator, which stabilized the predator-prey system.

The four functional responses were as follows: 
	•	Null response: assume that lions forage solitarily and prey are randomly distributed
#
Here the functional response asymptotes more quickly as the search rate (a) increases. As seen here, where the blue line is the lowest value of a. Handling time increases slow down the rate at which the rate asymptotes. Which makes sense: the faster you find prey, the more the rate increases, the more time it takes to subdue and consume, the slower the predation rate becomes. 

	•	Grouped lion functional response: which changes the handling time of prey 

￼
Here as group size increases, the total prey rate for an individual asymptotes at a lower value (here) The parameter a has the same effect as above, which is to increase the speed at which an individual approaches the maximum predation rate. 

What doesn’t make sense to me about this, is that the time it takes for the predator to subdue the prey (G*h1) I would have thought declines. Although I think what this functional response actually is: 
￼
The reasoning they give is that the amount that each predator gets from a carcass now depends on the group size, and so h2 should decline with group size, hence h2/G. 

They also say that the lions rarely team-up together, which is why they leave h1 alone. And they multiple the entire functional response by 1/G because you have to divide the “group capture rate” by the number of individuals in the group to get the per individual rate. But am confused why the term in the right brackets is the group capture rate..? 

Update: They say that because of perceptual overlap in the predators, the group searches for prey in the same way an individual does. So the encounter rate aN remains unchanged. And again, but lions rarely team up to take down prey, h1 remains unchanged. Which, even if the lion in question isn’t the one taking down the prey, they still have to wait h1 time units before they can consume the downed prey. 

	•	Grouped prey functional response: The encounter rate changes so that this functional response is a modified type II functional response (same as eq. 1) 

￼
Here they modified the encounter rate which is the search rate times the abundance (aN). Here they take the linear regression of ln(prey group density) versus ln(prey density). C is exp(intercept) and b is the slope of the regression line. Translated, that means that a larger c means that even at low density overall, groups still form (group density is still high relative even as individual density declines). Because it’s c = e^intercept, that means that it will increase exponentially rather than linearly with an increase in the intercept. The parameter b means that the shallower the slope (and thus the lower b) the smaller the change in grouping as overall prey abundance increases. Which means more prey go to existing groups then make more small groups.  Also should remember that the regression is a log-log plot. 

Basically, instead of the prey abundance scaling linearly with probability of encounter, when b = 1. When b &lt; 1, the encounter rate asymptotes, and the lower b is, the more rapidly (at a lower value) the encounter rate asymptotes at (see that here). And the lower b is, it means that most individuals join existing groups rather then form small groups. 

I don’t think you can have a b &gt; 1, it would mean there’s more groups than individuals…?

But also this assumes that groups are equally difficult to find as solitary individuals. That might be true of fish, that it’s basically hard to find all fish, regardless of whether they group. But for most prey, might it be easier to find groups? Not sure. 

Anyway, if you increase c from 0 -&gt; 1, the level that the encounter rate saturates increases. See here. 

	•	Functional response assuming both lions and prey are grouped: equations 2 and 3 are combined
￼

This is the result of combining the two grouping functional responses. Which decreases the predation rate more than either just prey or just predators grouping. 

For the lion, wildebeest case study, Fryxell et al found that because grouping of either predator or prey reduces the predation rate, it makes the system more bottom up. Thus predators are not able to depress prey populations. Although based on their models, only if prey group can predators remain in the population. And even when predators have a stable, nontrivial equilibrium, it’s a tiny sliver of parameter space.

            <Title>Holling:1959</Title>
            <Text>{Holling 1959}
{Holling 1959} first introduced the idea of a functional response, to relax the assumption that encounter rates increased linearly with abundance. 

Holling's functional response is [definition] 

Holling derived these functional responses by examining the predation of the European pine sawfly while in cocoons. Three small mammals prey on the cocooned sawflies.   [methods]

Conceptualizes that the predation rate (number of prey individuals consumed per unit time). Assumes that this predation rate may vary according to the densities of either the predator or the prey, characteristics of the prey or the predator, and alternate food sources available to the predator. In the experimental set up, the uniform habitat and cocooned sawflies means that you can assume there is no variation in alternate food available to predators, and that the sawflies do not respond to the predators. And because the predators are all the same, the habitat is the same and the interactions with prey items will not be affected by the prey, can assume characteristics of the predator don't matter. 

Thus Holling only considers how predator and prey density affect predation rate. Plots the number of consumed sawflies on the y axis and the abundance of cocooned sawflies on the x axis. 

Notes
Requires that you know true abundance underlying harvesting. But this is essentially what catch per unit is…? Catch per unit effort is assumed to go up with abundance. This is because animals always put out a set amount of 'effort'. But fishermen can put out a varying amount of effort, but also can be more efficient at encountering prey. 

I wonder how people model predation rate of predators that learn. I think it's the type III functional response. Which adds support for considering first what happens when a type III functional harvesting response is used. 

Although for fishermen, it's not necessarily true that they develop a 'search image' at some threshold density and quickly rise in predation efficiency. 

And it's also not true that fishermen max out at some handling rate-limited harvest rate. Certainly that's true on any given trip. But fishermen are then forced to return back to shore (or processor) to unload and start again. And management puts caps on total allowable catch. 

Solomon (1949) might be the first person to use the term 'functional response' to describe the change in the number of prey consumed by individual predators and the term 'numerical response' to describe the change in density of predators. 

This might be useful for fishermen too. Functional repsonse changes with information, gear, ecology, and the numerical response has to do with the total effort expended. </Text>

            <Title>CPUE</Title>
            <Text>Catch per unit effort (CPUE)

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is one of the most common forms of data used for fisheries management {Hilborn 1992}, and subject to considerable controversy, i.e. {Pauly 2013}. 

CPUE rests on the idea that the amount of catch for a standardized unit of effort reflects the underlying abundance of the fish population targeted. The simplest, and most common, assumption is that this relationship is linear: if CPUE remains constant, assumedly so does the abundance of the fish stock. 

CPUE is often used as an index of abundance that will reflect changes in management regimes {Hilborn 1992}. However there are documented cases [cite?] where the CPUE will remain high until fish abundances drop to very low levels (hyperstability), or CPUE can drop while true abundances remain high (hyperdepletion) {Hilborn 1992}. Further it's likely that as a fishery develops the spatial distribution of fish and fishermen will change, and these changes may not be reflected well in the aggregate CPUE measures {Hilborn 1992}. 

The explanations for a nonlinear relationship between CPUE and true abundance are typically a mix of expectations about the fishermen's behavior and the ecology of the fish targeted. Hyperstability is commonly believed to be found at small spatial scales when handling time is large, and at large spatial scales when searching is highly efficient {Hilborn 1992}. Hyperdepletion may be caused when the catchability of fish varies within the stock. If there is a subset of the population that is vulnerable to being caught, once these are removed, catch rates may decline drastically without a correspnding change in abundance {Hilborn 1992}. The linear CPUE is expected when handling times are low and search is random. This might be the case in some hook and line or net fishing operations at a single site, so long as the gear did not get over saturated {Hilborn 1992}. 


In US commerical fisheries this data is collected either from on-board observers, landing recods, or most commonly, log books {Hilborn 1992}. 


Catch data are a type of encounter, the result of fish encountering fishing gear. This data gives a direct estimation of the amount of fish removed from the stock, and thus can help determine how the fish population responds to exploitation {Hilborn 1992}. 

Because catch data are the result of an encounter, CPUE depends on the spatial distribution of fish, the effort of fishermen and the relationship between abundance and likelihood of capture {Hilborn 1992}.

When CPUE is directly proportional to abundance catch is   
#

Where C is catch, q is the efficiency of gear and E is the fishing effort {Hilborn 1992}. In order for this relationship to be true, effort must be distributed at random with respect to the fish. Because commercial fisheries are a business, this assumption is unlikely to be true {Hilborn 1992}, and the catch data will instead be a biased sample of high abundance locations. 

There is a good set of general expectations about how CPUE may vary nonlinearly with true abundance. These expectations consider the characteristics of the fishermen and the fish they target, and expect that the resulting population level CPUE will be due to the combination of these. 

For example, fishermen that search nonranodly and are limited by handling time are expected to show hyperstability (type II functional response), as would informations haring and interference (which can contribute to the former explanations, respectively).

            <Title>fisherman functional response notes</Title>
            <Text>Now the question becomes, what happens if I put a type II functional response in a scheffer model. 

The Scheffer model with constant effort is:

￼

The Scheffer model with a type II functional response is 

￼

If I collapse the two types of handling times and finding equilibria, N* = 0, non trivial equilibrium?

This is hard to solve. 

Also I’m missing an equation to describe fishermen. Doesn’t make sense to me that fishermen “die out” like lions might, but instead what if the dF/dt (change in fishermen)  is the fraction of fishermen (or the number?) fishing species N. Thus a decline in dF/dt doesn't mean that these fishermen are dying, but that they're switching to an unspecified superior choice (could be fishing, could be a non-fishing alternative). 

￼

This is not complete. All this is saying is that the amount of fishermen increase as the abundance of the stock increases to some level. What would be something unrelated to abundance that would draw fishermen away? Also there's no discussion of costs. Maybe the predation rate will increase in proportion to the total profit (price - cost). 

Price is $ per unit biomass, cost is maybe $ per unit biomass. But I imagine there's two types of costs. There's searching costs that are affected by your encounter rate, and costs with havesting fish you've already found. Marc Mangel's functional response is 

￼

He doesn't provide parameter definitions, but I imagine that c_max must be the encounter rate. Maybe C0 is a constant. If you plot this..

Other questions, thinking about how effort plays in. For lions, you assume that each predator puts in an average amount of effort in. Rather than there being both a numerical and individual. So here I think Mangel assumes instead of resolving it to individaul fishermen, aggregates all fishing vessels into effort. What implication would that have? Well effort probably is some function of the number of boats. 

The other question is how might the functional response change. First to think about is ecology. The grouping might be more extreme than wildebeest for fish. Where you rarely see any solitary individuals. Or rather, the variation in how you group might be between species.

So might think that the predation (fishing) rate would be lower on schooling species. But two things then come to mind. Schooling fish are far more mobile than solitary ones (right?). Would that make it easier or harder? Not sure. However that does indicate that the information you have about the past degrades more quickly over time than does a species that doesn’t move very much. 

Regarding the encounter rate, the Fryxell paper is the product of the effective search path, the travel velocity, and the probability of success per attack. These have direct analogy to fishermen. The travel velocity will depend on the boat and on the weather.

            <Title>Size-structured optimal harvesting</Title>
            <Text>Steve Pacala prompted me to think about for what type of species would fine scale harvesting patterns matter. In particular, he suggested that species that are size structured (substantial ontogenic shift in habitat due to size), and tend to self-assort by size, ought to be more sensitive in numerical dynamics to fishing patterns.

            <Text>Foraging Strategies
As previously mentioned, what's missing is a general treatment of how harvesting behavior can be expected to vary at the level of the individual and the population level implicatios for both the dynamics of the fish stock and the fishermen harvesting the species. 

This will be particularly valuable as it allow a more mechanistic understanding of population level phenomena. CPUE is a population level metric commonly used as a proxy for fish abundance in management analyses. CPUE is known to be nonlinearlly associated with true abundance and mechanisms have been suggested to account for such variation. 

In the 1980s there were several papers that demonstrated possible mechanisms: catchability is a random variable {Cooke 1984}, information sharing {Mangel 1983}, and others. 

However, to my knowledge there has been no rigorous theoretical treatment about how the foraging strategy of the fishermen should vary as a result of system level changes. {Hilborn 1992} discuss generally how CPUE should vary with characteristics of the fishermen and fish, and proposed that fishermen characteristics that improve search efficiency leads to hyperstable relationship between CPUE and catch, while spatial preferences lead to hyperdepletion. In fish, the distribution of the fish over space determine the relationship between CPUE and abundace, with none uniform distributions of fish generally leading to hyperdepletion. However it's not clear that the characteristics of the fishermen's searching efficiency will vary independently of the characteristics of the fish. Indeed, I expect that the harvesting strategy will vary depending on the fish ecology, the gear used, the information available and the management in place. 

Here I propose to construct a framework based on these listed atttributes to develop a set of hypotheses about how foraging strategies should vary with system level characteristics. 

In US commercial fisheries, fishermen are involved in a competitive foraging game. Fishing can be conceptualized as fishermen searching for food items (fish) in a series of patches. Given a set of patches and a distribution of prey, there may be an optimal way to allocate effort searching and harvesting. The decisions fishermen need to make are many: how to allocate search effort, when to leave one patch for another, and because fish are a depletable reasource, these decisions depends not only on the charteristics of the fishermen and the fish targeted, but on all the other boats strategies as well. </Text>

            <Synopsis>2 size-stage integrodifference model. Look at comparisons between proportional harvesting and MPA establishment. </Synopsis>
            <Text>I have found a paper, {Gaylord 2005}, which looks at how size structure changes the yields that MPAs return to fisheries. In this paper they find that MPAs will increase fisheries yields most for species that experience density dependence after dispersal, and that have sedentary, long-lived adults. 

Gives some ideas for crucial components to include for ecology:
- That all fish species have at least two distinct phases: larval (which includes dispersal) and fish

Methods
Here they use an integrodifference equation with Gaussian dispersal. They assume symmetric dispersal and that adults don’t move from where they are dispersed to. Also assume Beverton-Holt/Ricker density dependence either before or after larvae are dispersed. 

They add two stages to the model in order to capture the fact that older, larger adults tend to build up inside reserves. This change means that larvae not only compete with each other, but also with already-resident adults. They also assume that older adults have twice the reproductive rate as newly dispersed individuals, trying to mimic the fact that big adults are more fecund. Also assume that older individuals weigh 1.5x that of newly dispersed individuals. Again to account for increased biomass inside reserves. Both adults and juveniles are assumed to have the same natural survival rate, and juveniles move into the adult class at rate gamma. 

Fishing is implemented either “traditionally” or with MPA reserves. Traditional fishing is some specified fraction of the individuals are fished out uniformly across all space. With MPAs there is some fraction of land set aside from which no fishing takes place, while fishing occurs without restriction everywhere else. 

Notes
This means that they assume that there’s no spatial structure to the fish population except that imposed by MPAs. 

Results
Unsurprisingly, when pre-dispersal density dependence is present for a population that is not size structured, MPAs do worse than than traditional fishing in terms of fisheries yields. This is because the increase in fish density inside reserves reduces larval production. 

When size-structure is considered the MPA’s effectiveness is amplified. 

Main conclusions
MPAs should be extremely helpful for species that have post-dispersal density dependence, and adults whose fecundity increases with size and are sedentary. </Text>

            <Text>This paper, {Micheli 2004a}, looks at how a two-patch predator prey system responds when one patch is an MPA. This reminds me a lot of {Abramsetal:2012}. Interesting to see what the differences actually are. 

Notes
Mention the importance of spatial harvesting response in efficacy of reserve establishment and cites Walters (2000). 

Fisher and Frank (2002) might be a good resource for understanding which life-histories might be most vulnerable to spatial distribution of fishing effort. They have a 31 year data set of abundance over 70 species (that is publicly available, I think, in OBIS) and look at before and after a fishing ban was instituted. Find that there is a signficiant difference (in some? In all?) before and after, and that it may be related to dispersal ability. 

This paper explicilty asks the question: what combinations of species traits, enviornmental conditions and human interventions are more likely to lead to counterintuitive effects of protection. Which is a nice phrasing of what I want to do too. 

Methods
Make a predator-prey model with two patches, one where fishing takes place, one protected. Have two sets of parameters. The first describes the biology of the predator and prey: life history (prey growth rate, predator attack rate, and larval dispersal). The second describes management: the fraction of each species that is harvested outside the reserve and the fraction of area dedicated to the reserve. Then looked at consumer-resource dynamics as you vary the lifehistory and dispersal characteristics of the species, the size of the reserve and the fishing intensity outside of the reserve. 

Goal is to find what combinations of parameters lead to the extinction of one or both species.

            <Notes>Big questions
------------------
- Have people already looked through CPUE and human behavior?
- How do I go between individual-level ESS foraging strategies and population foraging responses?


Needing clarity 
-------------------
What actually is a 'harvesting strategy'?
	It could be the way you share information, or the way you allocate effort over space and time. Or a combination of both. At its root it's how you make decisions. In game theory a strategy "provides a rule for the individual at each instance of the game". Thus I need to define the game first and then determine what the type of (and possible) choices that are available. 


Need help breaking down into smaller questions
---------------------------------------------------
- Want to find the optimal harvesting strategy for individuals and for the management, compare them, and ask, can you shift the system in a way that makes the strategy that's optimal for management be the same as the one that's optimal for the individual? And if you can't, why not?


Concepts I need help clarifying
------------------------------------
- Toss around the idea of 'harvesting strategies' a lot. What does that actually mean? Hoping that clarifying this will help me think about more testable hypotheses for empirical data. 


Ideas that need sharpening
---------------------------------
- I like the idea of bottom up versus top down management and looking at how that should change encounter rate (bottom up, not going to share information with defectors) or the cost function (top down, fines for breaking the law). 
- Also like the idea of looking at adaptive dynamics. But that seems like it requires a population of homogeneous individuals.. Not sure that works so well for fishermen. Seems like fishermen have a number of constraints that change over longer timescales that could confound (family, social ties) that are not determined (or at all related) to fisheries dynamics. Not sure how this fits in. </Notes>

            <Text>Does information sharing promote group foraging?
Model bayesian group foragers in which individuals are homogenous, possess information of equal value and share the information equally. The key point of this model is that your probability of staying in the patch has to do with how many food items are left within it. 

The results of this study is to find the optimal amount of time to spend in a patch. The lower the number of the individuals in the group, the longer you stay in the group. However these policies depend on the search effiency, traveling time between patches, the mean number of food items in a patch and the variance in that mean. </Text>

            <Text>The New Fisheries Economics: Incentives across many margins

Broad move to align incentives of harvesters with the objectives of optimal management.

The Schaefer model predicts biological overexploitation and complete rent dissapation. 

The salience of this single-stock model comes from the fact that fisheries management has defined the commons problem as one of open access to a stock. THus incentives have been presented along this margin: fix this aspect of fisheries and the commons problem is solved. 

On the basis of this intuition, ITQs have been adopted widely in industrialized countries. And while there is evidence that adoption of catch shares has led to improved profits and biological outcomes, other work highlights the ways in which other margins are likely to matter. Fisheries may be interdependent on other stocks or other ocean uses (mining, shipping, etc.). 

Recent work in fisheries economics that examine these many margins is diverse topically and methodologically. Topically these works analyze within-season beahvior, fish life history, ecological dependence, spatial feastures, multispecies management, and market interactions. However all attempt to understand, measure, or design incentives that address margins that are left out of the single-stock surplus produciton model that characterizies fisheries as a system with a single input and single output. 

In this review {Smith 2012a} focuses on management approaches that are analogous to intensive and extensive margins. In the traditional Schaefer model, the intensive margin is the single input, effort, and the extensive margin is the single stock of fish. 

But in reality effort is not a single input, intensive margins can include amount and type of gear, number of trips and trip length, target species within a multispecies complex, fishing ground, and size of fish. Extensive margins can include entry into a new fishery, switching across fisheries or large regions, and opening up new fisheries, including species, fishing grounds, product types, or sizes of fish that once may not have been profitable. 

Although the lines between intensive and extensive margins can be blurry, many management problems in fisheries have been reduced to whether managers should control these various margins. 

Most of the following margins are internal to the fishery, but some, such as climate change or marine pollution originating for a sector outside the fishery, will still need to be accounted for when managers design policy. 

Although these issues have been in the literature for some time, and a close read of Clark (1990) will turn them up, recent advances are nudging the field towards important empirical questions. </Text>
            <Comments>Margins here are defined as ‘aspects’ I think. Or different dimensions of the commons problem. 
extensive margin: the number of usable inputs that can be employed

intensive margin: the amount of use extracted within a given extensive margin. </Comments>

            <Text>Harvesting patterns: linking fishermen behavior with resource dynamics

Dreyfus-León (2000) model fishing effort distribution using a Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate the effect of fishing effort on the age-structure of Pacific yellowfin tuna, which affects fisher revenues depending on market conditions and management policies. 

Yew and Heaps (1996) developed a model incorporating bio-socioeconomic effects of alternative management policies for a small pelagic fishery in northwest peninsular Malaysia. They showed that the existing policy of limited-entry licensing would not achieve the expected outcome as fishers could increase effort by fishing more days or by ‘capital stuffing’ their vessels. Yew and Heaps highlight the need for effort reduction by increasing employment opportunities outside the fishing sector and fostering skills for other activities through job training. 

Fisheries management has focused on a ‘how much can be taken’ approach (output controls), rather than managing how, when and where people fish \citep{@SalasGaertner:2004}. From an ecological point of view, this might present a problem when the ‘how’ makes a difference to stock dynamics.

            <Text>Why care about fishermen social behavior?

It’s been underdeveloped
In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by the management \citep{@vanPuttenetal:2012}

Policy changes may only be achieved with effective modeling of marine ecosystems which requires accurate modeling of resource users and the factors driving their behavior \citep{@vanPuttenetal:2012}. 

Interpretation of catch-based data could be influenced by the distribution of fishing effort and capacity. 

Possible benefits from understanding fisher behavior: Fulton et al. 2010, Prellezo et al 2009

Avoid Management Failures
Management failures are caused by ignoring fishermen’s behavior \citep{@SalasGaertner:2004}. \cite{@SalasGaertner:2004} take two observations: (1) that stock collapses are not unusual and (2) that managers tend to incorporate fishing as a simple, probably fixed, process, and suggests that this simplistic view of harvesting behavior could be what causes mismanagement and stock collapse. 

\cite{@SalasGaertner:2004} also reference a number of other papers that say that understanding fishermen’s behavior is as important as a knowledge of the species targeted. 

\cite{@SalasGaertner:2004} also reinforce my observation: that while a number of authors have emphasized the need to understand fisher behavior and use this for management, very actually report studies in this area. Specifically \cite{@SalasGaertner:2004} say that we need to be able to determine and anticipate the dynamics and distribution of fishing effort which can be used in modern stock assessments. 

\cite{@SalasGaertner:2004} specifically highlight examples where understanding fisher behavior might be helpful to management, e.g. Regulating the number of boats if catches are influenced by fisher experience or that it’s not helpful to search for the importance of fisher experience in a fleet with highly developed technology. And finally \cite{@SalasGaertner:2004} argue that without an understanding of fisher behavior non-compliance with management will be a serious problem. 

Assumption in fisheries that management protect the biological health of the resource. The type of management is only important in that it determines how the system generates economic rent. 

As long as there is compliance with management, the resource should be fine.

Melnychuk et al. meta-analysis found that the status of west coast groundfish stocks on west coast, found that type of management did not affect whether the fishery was biologically healthy. Concluded that as long as scientifically established quotas are set and enforced, particular management type is not important from biological perspective. 

looking at the gag fishery in the gulf of mexico, smith et al. 2008 found that treating harvester behavior exogenously versus endogenously gave different results for proposed management. 

The gag fishery has a number of overlapping regulations, but is mainly regulated on effort (how many days you can fish). Managers closed the fishery for one month in the spring to protect the gag when they spawn, and are most vulnerable to fishing. 

Treating harvesting behavior exogenously (i.e. harvesting behavior remains constant) this closure reduces fishing and increases biomass. Allowing harvesting behavior to be endogenous and responds to price, alternative fishing opportunities, and wheather, the fishermen fish more intensively in remaining open season during the year, and even more intensively in the few days during the spawning season that are open. 

Thus the seasonal closure stimulates fishing effort before and after its effective dates enough to completely negate itself in the short run. Since the spawning seasons goes Jan-April, and the closure only cuts on a month during the peak spawning season. 

Further the intensification during the spawning season decreases the number of older fish. </Text>

Could! could be! But we don’t even know how.

But also Branch et al. 2011 showed that catch data is pretty unreliable, and that wasn’t even because of effort changes. 
Again, no evidence. No examples.

Conveniently, this is mostly what we’re dealing with. Which lets me think less about intangibles such as ‘experience.’ Although possible that if sharing information is still important, experience does play a role. But not in where the fish are, but rather, how best to get information from peers.

            <Title>Type III functional response</Title>
            <Text>Based on discussions today with James, Eleanor, Andrew and Adrienne came up with a couple of ideas. 

Idea #1: Scheffer model with type III functional response. Unfortunately it looks like someone already did this last year, but should read it (have sent requrest to Princeton to get a copy of this article). 

Update! They did not do it. They looked at a predator-prey system in which the predator has a type III functional response. They look at what optimal harvesting would be (assuming constant effort). But don't look at the fishermen themselves having a type III functional response. Great news. 

But if it hasn't been done, then it likely is the case that there will be multiple stable states. And then the question is: well does the type III functional response well approximate how fishermen harvest fish?

Idea #2: Using {Fryxell 2007} as a starting point, making a new functional response to look at how fishermen group in space. 

{Fryxell 2007} shows that if you let prey and predators group you get lower predation rates than you woudl with a type II functional response. The novel bit about this is that they add what would happen if predators group. They use the type III functional response to approximate what happens if prey group. 

With help from James, Eleanor, Andrew and Adrienne, came up with a new functional response that approximates whether fishermen follow each other or not and looks at the fleet level predation rate. The paramters are as follows

Parameters
definition
dimension
range
Notes
ω
Speed of fisherman
Meters/time


β
Width of fishfinder
meters


α
Spatial decorrelation, how much fishermen overlap. 1/α is the overlap. 
Dimensionless
If T is the total number of fishermen α is between 1 and 1/T
If α = 1, that means there is no overlap, and if α = 1/T that means that all fishermen are clumped togehter
H_1
Time taken to haul fish onto boat
Time/fish


H_2
Fish put in freezer
Time/fish


T 
Total number of fishermen
dimensionless


q
catchability
dimensionless
Between 0 and 1


So the search rate is a = ωβq, which is m2/time. And the fleet level predation rate is 
#

And N is the density of fish (fish/m2). Then the idea is that α could be an evolvable parameter. Could do adaptive dynamics to see how spatial overlap of fishermen would change over time. 

Also could incorporate grouping on the part of the fish (so it would be a type III functional respone with our extra stuff put in)

￼

So the goals here are a few: I'd like to look at how this changes MSY, whether you see multiple stable states. And then plug it into adaptive dynamics. 

Should note that omega*beta (the search rate) is the equivalent of E. So to find MSY need to look at how yield is maximized in relation to those two terms. 

Also should make the functional response a type 3 by putting b exponenets on it

Then the next step is to think about profit. So profit might be something like

￼

This lets us think about top-down versus bottom up management. It's possible that bottom up would affect the encounter rate via information sharing, but the top down might be through the cost function. </Text>

Abstract Ecologicalregimeshiftsarerarelypurelyeco- logical. Not only is the regime shift frequently triggered by human activity, but the responses of relevant actors to ecological dynamics are often crucial to the devel- opment and even existence of the regime shift. Here, we show that the dynamics of human behaviour in re- sponse to ecological changes can be crucial in deter- mining the overall dynamics of the system. We find a social-ecological regime shift in a model of harvesters of a common-pool resource who avoid over-exploitation of the resource by social ostracism of non-complying harvesters. The regime shift, which can be triggered by several different drivers individually or also in combina- tion, consists of a breakdown of the social norm, sudden collapse of co-operation and an over-exploitation of the resource. We use the approach of generalised modelling to study the robustness of the regime shift to uncer- tainty over the specific forms of model components such as the ostracism norm and the resource dynamics. Im- portantly, the regime shift in our model does not occur if the dynamics of harvester behaviour are not included in the model. Finally, we sketch some possible early

1 Introduction
Many ecological systems can undergo large, sudden and long-lasting changes in structure and function (Scheffer et al 2001). Such changes, often called regime shifts1 or critical transitions (Scheffer et al 2009), have been found in a range of ecological systems, including eu- trophication of freshwater lakes, soil salinisation, degra- dation of coral reefs, collapse of fisheries and encroach- ment of bushland (Biggs et al 2012a).
Most ecological systems, and especially those sys- tems that are at risk of sudden nonlinear changes such as regime shifts, are subject to influence by humans (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Furthermore, humans not only influence the ecological system but also adapt their behaviour in response to ecological changes (Folke et al 2010). However, many traditional ecological modelling approaches reduce the social sub- system to a simple driver, such as fishing pressure or resource extraction rate (Schlu ̈ter et al 2012a). Mirror- ing this problem, in bioeconomic models of the optimal management of renewable resources the descriptions of resource dynamics are often very simple, with neither
1 In this article, we use the term ‘regime shift’ in a social as well as an ecological context. We intend the term ‘regime shift’ to be understood in such a social context as not (neces- sarily) a political regime change but rather any recognisably sudden, large and persistent change in the behaviour of rele- vant actors.

￼resource nor management strategy capable of regime shifts (with exceptions including recent work from eco- logical economics such as Cr ́epin and Lindahl 2009; Ho- ran et al 2011).
Here, we show that modelling changes in the be- haviour of the humans who interact with the ecologi- cal system is crucial to understanding regime shifts in the ecological populations. In particular, a central re- sult is that such systems, often referred to as social- ecological systems (Carpenter et al 2009), can display regime shifts that are absent from the ecological subsys- tem in isolation. We find that even a non-linear linkage between completely linear social and ecological subsys- tems, which have no regime shifts of their own, can induce regime shifts in the coupled system.
To develop these results, we analyse a social-ecological system that captures essential properties of a class of systems encountered frequently in natural resource man- agement: a common-pool resource, for which harvesters choose between a community-efficient co-operation or a self-interested defection that leads to over-harvesting, together with a social mechanism that encourages but does not guarantee co-operation (Ostrom 1990, 2006). We represent this system using two types of models: a generalised model, where the details of the processes in the system are left unspecified; and simulation models based on the model of Tavoni et al (2012) (hereafter re- ferred to as the TSL model) that have functional forms fully specified, as is necessary to perform time series simulations.
We search for possible regime shifts in this social- ecological system by analysing the fold bifurcations of the models. Fold bifurcations, one of a family of pre- cisely mathematically defined qualitative changes in the dynamical behaviour of a system (Kuznetsov 2010), can lead to regime shifts (Scheffer et al 2001). Bifurcation analysis of the generalised model therefore permits gen- eral statements about the presence and robustness of regime shifts over a wide range of systems. This gener- ality is useful when analysing social-ecological systems, in which the specific functional forms required by simu- lation models can be difficult to determine. Bifurcation analysis of simulation models allows us to test the gen- eralised results in specific cases and to predict the pres- ence and effects of regime shifts with respect to specific parameters of the simulation model.
Since regime shifts are sudden, persistent and often have significant consequences, early warning signals for an impending regime shift would be highly desirable. Early warning signals have recently been developed for regime shifts in ecological and physical systems (Schef- fer et al 2009, 2012). We perform preliminary inves- tigations on the possibility of using these early warn-
ings for regime shifts in social-ecological systems. We use the conventional variance and autocorrelation in- dicators (Dakos et al 2012b) as well as the generalised modelling-based early warning signal (Lade and Gross 2012).
Section 2 describes in greater detail the models and the methods used to analyse them, including bifurca- tion diagrams and generalised modelling for both bi- furcation analysis and early warning signals as well as conventional early warning signals. Section 3 presents the results of these bifurcation and early warning sig- nal analyses, and in Section 4 we discuss their implica- tions for modelling studies and for governance of social- ecological systems. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.
2 Methods
We begin by introducing background theory and the analytical tools we propose to use in our analysis, then describe the model to which they will be applied.
2.1 Bifurcation theory
Bifurcation theory describes sudden, qualitative changes in the dynamical behaviour of systems. Specifically, a bifurcation of a dynamical system occurs when a small, smooth change in a parameter of the dynamical system causes a qualitative change to the dynamics of the sys- tem (Kuznetsov 2010). In this article, we analyse the bifurcations of our social-ecological models to under- stand qualitative changes in their behaviour.
Regime shifts are a type of qualitative change in behaviour that can be caused by bifurcations (Kuehn 2011). One important type of regime shift-inducing bi- furcation is the fold bifurcation (Scheffer et al 2001). In a fold bifurcation, a stable fixed point collides with an unstable fixed point and both fixed points disappear (Fig. 1). A system initially on or near the stable fixed point will undergo a sudden and possibly large change in state to a distant attractor (in Fig. 1 this is another stable fixed point). This change is also persistent, as the parameter must often be changed to a significantly dif- ferent value in order for the system to transition back to the first fixed point. Mathematically, fold bifurca- tions occur (in the ordinary differential equations we use here) when a real eigenvalue of the Jacobian ma- trix at the fixed point passes through zero. The Jaco- bian matrix is a matrix of derivatives that characterises the dynamics of the system in the vicinity of the fixed point.

Fold bifurcations occur when a stable (solid lines) and an unstable (dashed line) fixed point collide, and lead to regime shifts. In the pair of fold bifurcations sketched here (manually, without computer simulation), a system on stable fixed point 1 will, upon the driver passing fold bifurcation 1, undergo a sudden and large shift to stable fixed point 2 (trajectory 1). This change is persistent, because the parameter must be returned to a value below fold bifurcation 2 (if this is possible) in order for the system to return to its original state, in another regime shift (trajectory 2).
Another important type of bifurcation that can also be detected with a generalised modelling analysis is the Hopf bifurcation, which often (in the case of supercriti- cal Hopf bifurcations) lead to a transition to oscillatory dynamics. A Hopf bifurcation occurs when the Jacobian matrix at a fixed point has a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues that pass through the imaginary axis (that is, have zero real part) (Kuznetsov 2010).
For simulation models of dynamical systems, where the forms of all interactions and the values of all pa- rameters are known, numerical continuation software are often used to locate and track bifurcations. Here, we used the software XPPAUT (Ermentrout 2011) to plot bifurcation diagrams of the form of Fig. 1, where the values of a parameter or ‘driver’ are plotted on the horizontal axis, and the stable and unstable fixed points of the system corresponding to each value of the driver on the vertical axis.
2.2 Generalised modelling for bifurcation analysis
Bifurcation diagrams give great insight into possible qualitative behaviours of the system. Frequently, how- ever, the forms of interactions and the values of param- eters in the model on which the bifurcation analysis was performed cannot be accurately known. In a related problem, if functional forms are chosen in a model, there can be significant uncertainty over whether conclusions
obtained from the model are of a general nature or are specific to the functional forms chosen.
The generalised modelling approach (Gross and Feudel 2006; Kuehn et al 2013) permits precise mathematical statements about bifurcations of a dynamical system to be made in the presence of uncertainties about its pre- cise form. Here, we use generalised modelling to make two types of inferences about a dynamical system. The first, and more traditional, use of generalised modelling will be to calculate the types of bifurcations that a gen- eralised model can and is likely to undergo. Further be- low, we use generalised models together with time series data to generate early warning signals for regime shifts.
A generalised modelling bifurcation analysis pro- ceeds as follows:
1. Write down a generalised model structure for the state variables and processes present in the system.
2. SymbolicallycalculatetheJacobianmatrixofafixed
point in this generalised model.
3. Parameterise the Jacobian matrix directly using the
so-called generalised parameters. Assign likely ranges of the generalised parameters based on knowledge of the system.
4. Calculate, using appropriate methods, the likely bi- furcations to which these values of generalised pa- rameters can lead.
This procedure will be described in further detail below with the aid of a simple example. We also note that the procedure described here above skips the normalisation step often used in previous generalised modelling stud- ies (Gross and Feudel 2006; Kuehn et al 2013). This leads to the presence of an additional parameter in the Jacobian, which we call the ‘steady-state ratio’ below, but which has no effect on the bifurcation analysis.
Generalised modelling shares its mathematical ba- sis, the bifurcations of dynamical systems, with both the qualitative theory of differential equations (Kelley and Peterson 2010) and catastrophe theory (Zeeman 1977). Indeed, generalised modelling could be consid- ered a systematic way of parameterising a model be- fore analysing its bifurcations with the tools of qual- itative differential equation theory. Two key points of distinction of the generalised modelling are that: (i) it parameterises the Jacobian matrix directly, rather than the original functional forms; and (ii) it provides a sys- tematic framework for connecting a generalised model structure to properties of real systems, through the gen- eralised parameters (see below) or time series obser- vations (in the case of a generalised modelling-based early warning signal). Generalised modelling therefore allows for the investigation of how processes, even in- completely characterised processes, lead to bifurcations

￼of the system. Frequent failure to investigate how system- specific processes could lead to the abstract, general geometries of catastrophes was a major contributor to the controversy over some strands of catastrophe theory (Guckenheimer 1978).
Conceptually, generalised modelling is also similar to systems dynamics approaches (Sterman 2000), struc- tural equation modelling (Kline 2011) and flexible func- tional forms (Chambers 1988). A generalised model could be considered a causal loop diagram or stock and flow diagram from system dynamics in mathematical form, which we then further manipulate to obtain general mathematical results without resorting to simulating specific systems. Like generalised modelling, structural equation modelling (SEM) explores the consequences of linkages within a network of interacting variables; un- like generalised modelling, SEM can statistically test for the presence and strength of linkages, but does not commonly explore nonlinear dynamics and transitions of the variables. In economics, flexible functional forms are a general way to determine functional relationships directly from data, but they generally are not forms that are convenient for a subsequent bifurcation analy- sis.
To formulate a generalised model, the important state variables in the system and the processes through which they interact must first be identified. As a sim- ple example, consider a single population X (which may be of animals, of people, of people holding a particular opinion) that can increase due to a gain process G(X) and decrease due to a loss process L(X), both of which may depend on the current population X. A generalised model, in differential equation form, for the population X is then
dX
dt = G(X) − L(X). (1)
To investigate the bifurcations of this generalised model, we assume that the system has a fixed point, that is, some value X∗ where if X(0) = X∗ then X(t) = X∗ for all t &gt; 0. Throughout this article we use the asterisk to denote a quantity evaluated at the fixed point. We then calculate the Jacobian matrix of the generalised model at the fixed point, and calculate the eigenvalues of the Jacobian, from which we can estab- lish stability and bifurcations as described in Sec. 2.1. For Eq. (1), the Jacobian matrix J consists of a single element which is also the eigenvalue, λ,
d G 􏰂􏰂 ∗ d L 􏰂􏰂 ∗
J=λ= − . (2)
To better relate the derivatives in the model to prop- erties of a real-world system, we re-write Eq. (2) in a different form. We introduce:
– the scale parameter α = G∗/X∗, which, with di- mensions of inverse time, is a measure of the char- acteristic time scale of X.
– the dimensionless elasticity parameters
X ∗ d G 􏰂􏰂 ∗ X ∗ d L 􏰂􏰂 ∗
G = and L = . X G ∗ d X 􏰂􏰂 X L ∗ d X 􏰂􏰂
The elasticity parameters give an indication of the non-linearity of the process near the fixed point. For example, a linear function f (x) = ax has elasticity 1 for all x. A constant function f(x) = a has elasticity 0 for all x.
The scale and elasticity parameters, and in more com- plicated examples another type of parameter called the ratio parameter, are collectively referred to as gener- alised parameters, as they are used to represent the dy- namics of a general class of models rather than parame- terising a particular model. Using these generalised pa- rameters, Eq. (2) becomes
λ=α(GX −LX),
where we have also used the fact that G∗ = L∗.
Next, we identify what conditions on the generalised parameters can give rise to different types of bifurca- tions. As described in the previous section, a zero eigen- value of J indicates a fold bifurcation, while a pair of imaginary conjugate eigenvalues indicates a Hopf bifur- cation. In this simple example, we can conclude that no Hopf bifurcations are possible (since there is only one eigenvalue, which is real) and, provided α &gt; 0, a fold
bifurcation can only occur when GX = LX .
The final step of the generalised modelling process is to make use of contextual knowledge about the pro- cesses to evaluate the likelihood of the identified bi- furcations. In this example, suppose we know that the loss process L(x) is approximately linear (elasticity 1), while the gain process G(X) is linear at X = 0 (elastic- ity 1) but saturates at high X (elasticity 0). Therefore LX ≈1and0&lt;GX &lt;1foranynon-zeropopulationso a fold bifurcation is unlikely. If, however, G(X) took a sigmoidal-type shape (with a quadratic or higher-order shape near X = 0) then the elasticity GX could reach
and exceed 1 and a fold bifurcation may be possible. The generalised model that we analyse below is two- dimensional. For this system, we search for bifurcations by identifying combinations of generalised parameters

for Hopf bifurcations, where tr denotes the trace of the matrix.2 We also test whether det J (for fold bifurca- tions) or tr J (for Hopf bifurcations) changes sign at the candidate bifurcation points, as is necessary for a true bifurcation.
2.3 Early warning signals
Consider a dynamical system that is undergoing noisy fluctuations due to a fast noise forcing. As the dynam- ical system approaches a fold bifurcation the standard deviation of these fluctuations, under a linear approx- imation, diverges to infinity and their autocorrelation increases towards one (Scheffer et al 2009; Kuehn 2013). Although the linear approximation will not hold arbi- trarily close to a fold bifurcation, increasing variance and autocorrelation are two well-known early warning signals that have both been shown to precede regime shifts in simulation studies, in laboratory and field ex- periments and in data of past regime shifts (Lenton 2012; Scheffer et al 2012).
We examine whether variance and autocorrelation early warning signals also precede the regime shifts we explore in our social-ecological system. To calculate the early warning signals we use the R package ‘earlywarnings’ (Dakos et al 2012a) developed by Dakos et al (2012b). A bandwidth of 20 for the detrending of the time series was used.
We also explore a third early warning signal, the re- cently developed generalised modelling-based early warn- ing signal (Lade and Gross 2012). Unlike the variance and autocorrelation approaches, which rely purely on time series data of the system, this approach also makes use of structural knowledge about the system. As the name suggests, the approach begins by constructing a generalised model and then formally calculating its Ja- cobian matrix as described in Sec. 2.2. Instead of as- signing ranges to the elements of the Jacobian matrix through generalised parameters, time series observa- tions of the state variables and processes are used to directly estimate the derivatives in the Jacobian ma- trix. The particular computations used to estimate the derivatives depend on the structure of the generalised

model and on the available data; we will derive an al- gorithm appropriate to the model studied here.
2.4 Social ostracism and resource model
We use the tools described above to analyze regime shifts in a stylised social-ecological model. Based on the TSL model, we consider a resource, of resource level R, that is being harvested by a community of users. A proportion fc of the harvesters co-operate to harvest at a socially optimal level while the remaining harvesters ‘defect’ and harvest at a higher level out of self-interest.
We write the resource dynamics in generalised form as
dR = c − D(R) − Q(E(fc), R), (5) dt
where c is the resource inflow or growth rate (and is independent of the current resource level), D(R) is the natural resource outflow rate or mortality, and Q(E, R) is the resource extraction. Here E(fc) is the total effort exerted by the harvesters, which decreases with increas- ing proportion of co-operators. In practice, the resource could be fish in a fishery, water in an irrigation system, an unpolluted atmosphere, etc.
We, like TSL, use the replicator dynamics of evo- lutionary game theory to model the dynamics of the fraction of co-operators fc. In its most general form, the replicator equation for two strategies is dfc/dt = fc(1 − fc)(Uc − Ud), where Uc and Ud are the utilities for a co-operator and a defector, respectively. In our model, the utilities of defectors and co-operators can differ in three ways.
First, the income received by defectors and co-operators differs due to their harvesting activities, by an amount we denote by F(E,R) &gt; 0 that depends on the cur- rent resource level R and the total effort E. Second, the costs incurred by defectors and co-operators differ due to their harvesting activities by an amount W &gt; 0. We expect both income and costs to be higher for defec- tors than for co-operators, since defectors invest more effort.
The income difference minus the cost difference con- stitutes the payoff difference between defectors and co- operators. Like TSL, we include a third difference be- tween co-operator and defector utility, that the defec- tors can be socially ostracised by the co-operators, to reduce the utility of the larger payoff that they would otherwise obtain. We denote by ω(fc) &gt; 0 the degree to which ostracism reduces a defector’s utility, with the property that the size of this reduction is expected to in- crease with increasing fc. Ostracism can occur with the

￼presence of individuals in the community with other- regarding preferences (Fehr and Fischbacher 2002) and when fear of community disapproval leads to pressure to conform with the social norm (Cialdini and Goldstein 2004).
We note that the social ostracism modelled by TSL, which we follow in generalised form here, is non-costly, in that it does not cost the co-operators to impose this punishment. Non-costly ostracism may occur when the community builds upon available social capital (Bowles and Gintis 2002) to deny defectors important services, such as refusing to loan machinery or refusing trans- portation to market (Tarui et al 2008; Tavoni et al 2012). Indeed, sanctioning can even provide benefits to the enforcer (Ostrom 1990). Other models in which co- operation is encouraged in a non-costly manner include those of Os ́es-Eraso and Viladrich-Grau (2007), Iwasa et al (2007) and Tarui et al (2008).
These three differences between co-operator and de- fector utility result in the following equation for changes in the fraction of co-operators,

3 Results
3.1 Generalised modelling bifurcation analysis
Following the generalised modelling procedure, let there be a fixed point (R, fc) = (R∗, fc∗) where dR/dt = dfc/dt = 0. Furthermore, we concentrate on mixed- strategy fixed points, 0 &lt; fc &lt; 1. Pure strategy (fc = 0 or 1) fixed points also (indeed, always) exist, but we will see below (Fig. 4) that it is usually the bifurcations of the mixed-strategy fixed points that give rise to regime shifts. The Jacobian matrix of the generalised model in Eqs. (5-6) evaluated at this fixed point is

−αfFEEfc +αf(1−βF)ωfc with the generalised parameters as defined in Table 1.
￼As described in the Supporting Text (Section 1), some of our definitions differ from those originally used by TSL. These changes were made in order to reduce Eq. 6 to a number of unknown functions and parameters that is as small as possible while still clearly representing the processes at work in the social-ecological system.
Eqs. (5-6) constitute our generalised model of social ostracism and resource dynamics, hereafter referred to as ‘our social-ecological model’. We denote by the eco- logical or social subsystem the relevant part of the sys- tem with any feedback from the other part set to a constant value. It is clear that there are two key pro- cesses that link the ecological and social subsystems: extraction of the resource Q, and the income (differ- ence) F gained by harvesters due to extraction (Fig. 2). For both these processes, the effect of the social subsys- tem is mediated by the total effort E of the harvesting community.
To illustrate or to test our generalised modelling we will also produce time series data using simulation models. For this purpose we will use the original TSL model as described in the Supporting Text (section 1), and modifications thereof as described below. The TSL model is a specific case of our generalised model; the precise correspondence is shown in the Supporting Text.
We also use simulations of the TSL model, with added process noise, to test the early warning signals. On R the noise is purely additive; for fc the appropriate Ito ̄ noise term has variance proportional to fc(1 − fc)

a The effort elasticity is negative because an increase in co-operators decreases the effort. The elasticity is zero under full defection (fc = 0), because a large fractional change in the number of co-operators leads to a small fractional change in the total effort. In the TSL model, the elasticity takes its largest negative value at full co-operation (fc = 1).
b The particular ostracism function chosen by TSL causes the elasticity ωfc to reach extremely high values at values of fc where the magnitude of the function ω(fc) itself is very small. Another function that reproduces TSL’s ω(fc) very closely is ω(fc) = 0.34fc8/(0.558 + fc8), which has the more reasonable range of elasticities indicated above.
c The state variable ratio δR is not required in any of the following calculations. fc
Using J and the condition in Eq. (3), we find that for generalised parameters corresponding to the TSL model (Table 1), fold bifurcations are widespread (Fig. 3). Specifically, for any combination of ωfc and DR in the range plotted, there is an Efc that leads to a fold bifurcation. This matches the bifurcations observed by TSL both in their previous work, as indicated by the appearance and disappearance of their mixed equilib- rium states, as well as in an upcoming study (Schlu ̈ter et al in prep.).
Although the Jacobian J does permit Hopf bifur- cations for some extreme parameter combinations, the Hopf conditions [Eq. (4)] are not simultaneously satis- fied anywhere in the generalised parameter space plot- ted in Fig. 3. We conclude that Hopf bifurcations, and consequently oscillatory states, are unlikely to be ob- served for models similar to the TSL model.
If we ignore the social dynamics in this system and set the total effort E to a constant, the eigenvalue at a fixed point of R in the ecological subsystem is
λecol = −αRβRDR − αR(1 − βR)QR.
Provided that DR and QR are always positive (as they are in the TSL model), this eigenvalue is always nega- tive. Therefore, in this model, no bifurcation can occur and in particular no regime shift can occur. It is clear

that by ignoring the social dynamics it is impossible to appropriately model the regime shift that can occur in our social-ecological system.
To obtain a regime shift in the ecological subsystem alone, DR or QR would have to be sufficiently negative for λecol to reach zero. In traditional models of ecologi- cal regime shifts, this is achieved because D(R) (or in- flow rate, which here is a constant c) is sufficiently non- linear. There are of course many ecological and physical

￼systems with such a regime shift-inducing non-linearity (Scheffer et al 2001). Our purpose here is to show that regime shifts of ecological states can occur even if the ecological subsystem alone does not have a regime shift.
Returning to Fig. 3 we note, in addition to the ubiq- uity of fold bifurcations, that (i) fold bifurcations are possible for a large range of ωfc , including values near 1, and (ii) that the presence of fold bifurcations is not strongly affected by the value of DR. This indicates that close to linear ostracism and resource outflow functions ω(fc) and D(R) may be sufficient to produce a fold bifurcation. We confirm this prediction below using a simulation model.
Furthermore, setting ω(fc) ∝ fc and D(R) ∝ R removes all non-linearity from both the purely social and purely ecological components of the dynamics. The only remaining non-linearities are contained in the link- age between the social and ecological subsystems. This linkage is comprised by the processes Q(E,R), which specifies the amount of resource extracted by the har- vesters, and the income difference F (E, R), which spec- ifies the effect of resource extraction on the fraction of co-operators.3 Thus as well as arising from non-linearities in the ecological or social dynamics, regime shifts can also arise from non-linearities in the linkages between them.
3.2 Bifurcations of simulation models
We next tested the general predictions of the gener- alised modelling analysis above with simulations of the TSL model, and variants thereof.
Beginning with the parameter set used by TSL (see Supporting Text, Section 1), changing the resource in- flow readily triggered a fold bifurcation (Fig. 4a). In fact, changes in any of many different drivers, includ- ing effort cost (Fig. 4e), the strength of ostracism (Fig. 4f), or even multiple drivers changing simultaneously (resource inflow and effort cost, Fig. 4g), could trig- ger the fold bifurcation. We conclude that, as predicted by the generalised modelling analysis, fold bifurcations and therefore regime shifts are easy triggered in our social-ecological model.
Somewhat counter-intuitively, the regime shift from a high co-operation state that led to breakdown of the social norm and collapse of the resource was triggered by an increasing resource inflow, countering the com- mon understanding that it is scarcity that leads to con- flict. In this model, the regime shift occurred due to an initially increasing resource level that led to a greater

increase in the defector income than in co-operator in- come, due to allocation of net production according to effort. Increased defection then decreased the effective- ness of social ostracism and also increased extraction of the resource, culminating in a collapse in co-operation and in resource levels.
The bifurcation remained (Fig. 4b) when we used a variant of the TSL model with ω(fc) ∝ fc and D(R) ∝ R (Supporting Text, section 1). The size of the regime shift was not as large as in the case of strongly non- linear ω(fc) (Fig. 4a), however. We conclude that, as predicted by the generalised modelling analysis, the pres- ence of the regime shift is robust to the functional form of the ostracism process ω(fc), and also to the func- tional form of the resource outflow D(R). As predicted by the generalised modelling analysis, a simulation model of the ecological subsystem alone, however, did not have a bifurcation (Fig. 4h).
Although the ecological subsystem alone does not display a regime shift, the consequences of the social- ecological regime shift can be just as serious for the resource levels as a purely ecological shift. The regime shift associated with increasing resource inflow (Fig. 4a) led to a significant drop in resource levels (Fig. 4c). The total payoff (income minus costs) that the community received also collapsed (Fig. 4d). In this state, social ostracism is largely ineffective due to the small pop- ulation of co-operators. Re-establishing the ostracism norm and the associated high resource state would in this model require a large drop in resource inflow, or may even be impossible in the absence other mecha- nisms to re-establish the norm.
3.3 Early warning signals
A good standard deviation or autocorrelation warning signal should display a clear upwards trend well in ad- vance of the critical transition. In the early warning lit- erature, these trends in indicators are often quantified with the Kendall-τ statistic (Dakos et al 2012b). We applied the standard early warning suite to time series of both R and fc leading up to the transition (Fig. 5). We observed, for the simulation dataset used (Fig. 5, first row), weak trends in autocorrelation and stronger trends in standard deviation (largest Kendall τ statistic 0.86 for standard deviation of residuals of fc).
We next constructed a generalised modelling-based early warning signal. We assumed that the following quantities could be measured:
– The resource level, R
– The fraction of co-operators, fc

￼– The resource outflow, D (for example, natural fish mortality or natural water losses due to evaporation or outflow). Could be replaced by observations of resource inflow c if more easily measured.
– The total resource extraction, Q (for example, total fish caught or total water used for irrigation)
– The income difference between a defector and a co- operator, F .
– The cost difference between a defector and a co- operator, W .
We assumed that the regime shift was being triggered by changes in resource inflow c and/or effort costs W. To complete the generalised modelling analysis we also required the assumptions that: resource extraction is linear in the resource level, Q ∝ R; and income differ- ence is sub-linear in resource level with known elasticity b, F ∝ Rb. We found however that the results of the generalised modelling early warning signal are not sen- sitive to the value of b used. In the following, we used b = 0.5, significantly different to the elasticity actually used in the simulation (b = 0.2).
Following the approach outlined by Lade and Gross (2012), we derived an algorithm to calculate the eigen- values of the generalised model from the quantities in the above list (Supporting Text, Section 2). Key out- puts of this algorithm included the derivatives of the in- come difference F , resource extraction Q and ostracism ω with respect to the fraction of co-operators fc.
From the TSL model with changing parameters de- scribed at the end of Section 2.4, we generated time series for the list of quantities above. We then applied our algorithm, which yielded time series of two eigenval- ues. A clear warning signal would be a negative (stable) eigenvalue increasing consistently towards the stability boundary of zero eigenvalue. One of the eigenvalues we calculated was always stable and far from the stabil- ity boundary. The other eigenvalue, however, displayed a clear increasing trend (Fig. 5, Kendall tau statistic 0.760).
On the basis of these results, we find standard devi- ation and generalised modelling eigenvalue to be good candidates for early warning signals for regime shifts in this social-ecological system. However we empha- sise that these are preliminary results. A more thor- ough analysis would explore the sensitivity of the ob- served trends to different algorithm parameters such as smoothing or detrending constants and rolling window size (Dakos et al 2012b), a consideration of false alarm and missed detection rates through receiver-operator characteristics (Boettiger and Hastings 2012), as well as repetitions over an ensemble of realisations of the noise.
The early warning signal approaches described here also have differing demands on the amount and type of data and knowledge required. The autocorrelation and standard deviation approaches require only high- frequency observations of a single quantity. The gener- alised modelling-based warning signal, in contrast, re- quires knowledge of the structure of the social-ecological system as well as regular observations of all state vari- ables and several of the processes by which they inter- act. It is hoped that, for some regime shifts, such ad- ditional, system-specific information will improve the reliability of the warning signal, as well as decreasing the frequency at which time series need to be sampled (Lade and Gross 2012; Boettiger and Hastings 2013).
The generalised modelling approach for early warn- ing signals is also itself in an early stage of develop- ment. Future improvements could include statistical ap- proaches: to incorporate partial knowledge about deriva- tives in the Jacobian matrix; similar to the approach of Boettiger and Hastings (2012), to test the fit of alter- native generalised models; and to calculate the level of confidence in an early warning trend.
4 Discussion and implications for management
In the social-ecological system studied here, the ecologi- cal subsystem could not by itself undergo a regime shift at all, whereas regime shifts in the social-ecological sys- tem were common. The results of the social-ecological regime shift were as dramatic as purely ecological regime shifts that occur when the human impact acts as a sim- ple driver: there was a rapid, large and persistent col- lapse of the resource, along with an associated collapse of the social norm and community payoffs. We conclude that failing to model a natural resource as a social- ecological system, which requires including the dynam- ics of human (and institutional) behaviour, can lead to severely underestimating the potential for regime shifts. In a related result, undesirable regime shifts were previ- ously shown to be avoidable if multiple feedbacks from the state of a complex ecological system were incorpo- rated into management planning (Horan et al 2011).
The generalised modelling analysis showed the regime shift persists under variations to the shape of the os- tracism function and the natural resource outflows. A regime shift even occurred when the social and eco- logical subsystems were completely linear, with non- linearities arising only in the extraction and production processes that link the two subsystems. These findings have two implications for natural resource management. First, careful attention should be paid to the links be- tween natural resources and human actors, for example, the way ecosystem services are used and contribute to
12

￼human well-being. The link between natural resources and human well-being are in particular not well stud- ied. Second, social-ecological systems that under cur- rent conditions are managed sustainably through high levels of cooperation (such as the Maine lobster fishery, Acheson and Gardner 2011) could potentially easily be destabilised by small changes in or increasing variability of important processes. This becomes particularly rel- evant in the context of global change, where resource dynamics are expected to become more variable or more extreme, thus potentially pushing a successful system rapidly into an unsustainable state.
Indeed, the ease with which a regime shift can be triggered lends support to a precautionary-like approach to managing social-ecological systems (Raffensperger and Tickner 1999): assume the system can undergo regime shifts, unless there is evidence otherwise. Such a precautionary approach may imply, for example: hold- ing stocks at higher levels (Polasky et al 2011); using generic principles for increasing resilience (Biggs et al 2012b), such as engaging in a process of adaptive gover- nance; or preparing to mitigate the effects of the regime shift if it is unlikely to be avoided (Cr ́epin et al 2012).
Examining regime shifts demands viewing the social- ecological system as a complex adaptive system (Levin et al 2012). As well as the possibility of non-equilibrium behaviour (such as regime shifts), an important com- plex adaptive property of the system we studied here is the ability of human actors to switch their harvesting strategies in response to changing resource levels. The tool of generalised modelling that we have used com- bines a complex adaptive systems view of the social- ecological system with a precise mathematical setting and the ability to obtain results in the presence of un- certainty about specific forms of interactions. Given the high degree of uncertainty often associated with the detailed workings of social and ecological processes, we anticipate generalised modelling to be a useful tool in future work on social-ecological systems. Although recently developed, generalised modelling (sometimes also called structural kinetic modelling) has already yielded successes in ecology (Gross et al 2009; Aufder- heide et al 2012), physiology (Zumsande et al 2011) and molecular biology (Steuer et al 2006; Gehrmann and Drossel 2010; Zumsande and Gross 2010), where the details of specific interactions can likewise be difficult to determine.
We also studied regime shifts in our social-ecological system using a simulation model. The regime shifts could be triggered by many different social and eco- logical drivers, and also a combination of drivers. We also obtained the result, on first glance counterintuitive, that increasing the resource inflow led to a collapse of
co-operation and sudden decrease in the resource level and payoffs, due to the defectors gaining more from an increase in resource level than co-operators. We con- clude that sometimes not only can the regime shift it- self be surprising, but the direction of change in a driver that triggers a regime shift can also surprise.
Given the widespread existence and sometimes sur- prising nature of these social-ecological regime shifts, some early warning of an impending regime shift would be highly desirable, in order to avoid or at least miti- gate the effects of the regime shift. We tested the perfor- mance of standard early warning signals for one of the regime shifts produced by the TSL model. The autocor- relation warning signal showed only a weak indication of the transition, with standard deviation (particularly of fc) and the generalised modelling-based signal show- ing stronger signals. In practice, the effectiveness of an early warning signal can depend on a number of factors, including: the magnitude of the noise (Contamin and Ellison 2009; Perretti and Munch 2012); appropriate choice of variable(s) to observe; whether a potential as- sociated with the dynamics exists and is smooth (Hast- ings and Wysham 2010); the rate at which the driver is changing relative to the inherent time scales of the systems, such as life spans (Bestelmeyer et al 2011); the observation rate compared to these inherent time scales (Bestelmeyer et al 2011); non-stationary noise statistics (Dakos et al 2012c); and indeed whether the regime shift is driven at all or is instead triggered by noisy fluctuations (Ditlevsen and Johnsen 2010). The auto- correlation, standard deviation and generalised mod- elling early warning approaches also have different re- quirements for the amount and type of data and knowl- edge required (Sec. 3.3). We conclude that early warn- ing signal approaches show potential for warning of social-ecological regime shifts, which could be valuable in natural resource management to guide management responses to variable and changing resource levels or changes in resource users. However, investigation of spe- cific cases of social-ecological regime shifts is required to ascertain, first, the availability of the required data in those cases and, second, the robustness of the resulting early warning signals.
A third and very important criterion by which to evaluate an early warning signal in a specific case study is whether the signal can give sufficiently early warn- ing for the transition to be avoided. Successfully avert- ing a transition depends on a number of case-specific factors, including which drivers can be manipulated (Biggs et al 2009), the rate at which this can be done (Biggs et al 2009), how fast the system responds to a change in management (Contamin and Ellison 2009), and, importantly, how fast the uncontrolled driver is

￼itself changing. In the limit of a very slowly changing driver, for example, warning signals are likely to pro- vide sufficient notice for action to be taken, while in the limit of a very quickly changing driver, effectively an unpredictable shock, no warning signal could be suf- ficiently fast. Including management responses in the social-ecological system and evaluating whether warn- ing signals can give sufficient notice for management actions to avert a regime shift are beyond the scope of the stylised models used here. A thorough investi- gation would require more detailed mechanistic mod- els as well as data pertaining to actual social-ecological regime shifts (Schlu ̈ter et al 2012b).
5 Conclusions
We studied stylised models of a social-ecological sys- tem of broad relevance: a common-pool resource, which is being harvested, and for which a normative mecha- nism amongst harvesters (social ostracism) encourages a socially optimal harvesting strategy. We found that neglecting the dynamics of the social subsystem of the social-ecological system led to models missing the exis- tence of regime shifts in the system, regime shifts which could be as persistent and economically detrimental as a purely ecological regime shift. Furthermore, we found the regime shift to be robust to uncertainty about the specific shapes of the interaction processes, leading us to support the inclusion of regime shifts within a pre- cautionary approach to managing ecosystems. Finally, we also showed that the early warning signals developed for ecological or physical systems may also be useful for anticipating regime shifts in social-ecological systems.

            <Text>So a couple of different levels here. There’s the fact that humans affect community dynamics. Either through extinctions, invasive species, harvesting, pollution, or climate change. Lot’s of direct and indirect changes occurring because of human-actions.  And accordingly human impacts are being studied. But the studies end up looking like this:

#

Which is, animals affect each other, but humans only ever impact the environment. The implication is that human impacts are either a) static or b) changed by conditions exogenous to the ecological system. But is that always the case?

Like I said, human impact can happen in a variety of ways, some direct and others indirect. My contention is that, at least when you talk about direct harvest, humans’ harvesting practices are shaped in part by the ecological system. And so, when the ecological system changes, so does the harvesting, quantitatively, possibly qualitatively. Harvesting in turn changes ecological dynamics, and so on. Thus the system is better conceptualized like below. And that when we model harvested populations, it’s important to include the variation in harvester behavior endogenously.

￼

What’s the evidence? (how do you know?)
In a more general sense, the idea of changes in the ecological system transferring back and forth from human to ecological system is not novel. The Ghana trophic cascade is an example: humans killed off top predators to protect livestock and themselves, olive baboons increased in abundance, shifted diet and starting raiding crops and livestock. Kids were increasingly pulled out of schools to protect fields. Thus changes in human impacts in the system caused a shift in the ecological community which caused further changes for the human one. Grazing systems also are probably examples. [More details here!]

More generally, social-ecological systems is a term introduced to describe the interdependence between social and ecological subsystems, and define a system comprising both subsystems. 

There’s evidence that human communities are affected by their environment (probably not a new idea to social scientists) on slow time scales — generation of norms as in the Brazilian study. But actual evidence that human behavior can be changed by (and change) ecological systems is hard to find. However I suspect that fishing provides a good case study. 

Fishing is a direct harvest of animals from an ecological community, and as such has immediate numerical effects. However traditionally fishing is considered exogenous to the ecological system. It’s an impact that has been long studied, but assumed to be controlled by management (you’ll only fish a TAC) and at low resolution (fish anywhere is this XX square mile area). As we continue to discover that micro scale processes are often key in generating macro-scale patterns (such as dispersal, etc.) the fine scale pattern of harvesting might matter also. 

Further chorus of voices in the literature saying that fishermen behavior might matter. Most intriguingly, that we see collapses of fish populations in highly managed fisheries. The automatic response is that there are still too many ecological unknowns, and it is certainly true that there are ecological unknowns. But the other part that’s completely left out of management is thinking about how fishermen will respond to changes in stock, management and other system variables (this comes from Smith’s paper. One of them). 

This is what I propose to do here at Princeton. 

I think that if you include human harvesting behavior, the management prescriptions that will come out will be very different. 

What management prescriptions are likely to change? Are there certain classes of management for fisheries?
	•	Output versus input (TAC, versus gear/day/spatial restrictions)
	•	Privatized versus… not?

Have two tacks for this. The first is analytical modeling based on social foraging theory, to make predictions on what optimal foraging strategies for fishermen should be if you’re only considering the ecological, technological, and informational characteristics of the system plus the management constraints. This should act as a null model and can be compared to empirical data from fisheries to see if fishermen are making a strategy based on these characteristics. 

The other way is to use an ABM to explore things

            <Notes>What feels immediate:
• Running the ABM to look at what happens when complete information versus no information

• figuring out what the analytical models will do. What subset of management/system characteristics am I interested in

• analytical patch choice model. </Notes>

Attempt at Abstract
Throughout history humans have been busy restructuring their environment both purposefully and indirectly through resource consumption patterns. These anthropogenic impacts, when considered, have traditionally been treated as exogenous variables. Increasingly there are calls for quantitatively linking both ecological and economic processes to make explicit connections and feedbacks between human and non-human communities to mange environmental problems. Fishermen (and their direct harvest of fish) provide an ideal model system to examine whether consideration of human harvesting behavior can improve management policy. In this talk I will present a research agenda that seeks to understand under what conditions human harvesting behavior is likely to be important for fisheries management.

There's a gap in the literature: either there's lots of detail about fish and harvesting is very simplistic (as in Julia Baum paper that's a huge EBM that looks at how climate change will affect the food web but includes harvesting as a very simple 15% constant effort type harvesting). Or the human behavior is more complex but the fish dynamics are simple (Clark &amp; Mangel looking at how people should share information over space, but not considering how this distribution of harvesting affects the fish). 

This leaves a hole to consider how the ecology of the fish and the behavior of the fishermen jointly determine a fishery system's dynamics. 

That said, there are a number of case studies that look to determine fishermen's harvesting behavior over space, but none that consider feedbacks between the two subsystems. 

This is similar to predator prey literature in relaxing the Lotka-Volterra predator prey rate that was based on ideal-free-gas. At the most simplistic level, this assumptions have been primarily accounted for by using different functional responses. These functional responses can account for nonlinear interactions between predators and prey. (Encounter rate paper in Theoretical Ecology)

This idea fits neatly into the paradigm of social-ecological systems (explanation of why it fits, maybe a bit of background?)</Text>
            <Comments>RUM models, need to run through my case studies to be sure. 
See paper from Theoretical Ecology 2013</Comments>
            <Notes>Current spot:

Project 1: pretty good, need to do thorough check of literature to make sure there’s no one else who has looked at this. 

Project 2: Need to look at Holling’s work to see how he goes from mechanism to functional response. Can I go backwards? I can see that a nonlinear predation rate should change stability of fisheries system, but how do I determine if fishermen are likely to exhibit this functional response? Also should skim the 14 most interesting papers, are these the types of data that could contribute to functional response calculations?

Project 3: Are commercial fisheries truly determined by an MSY with constant effort slapped on top of a complicated statistical size/age structured model? Print out the Hilborn &amp; Walters book to find out. 

Project 4: What type of data would I need to test the theoretical predictions of harvesting strategy? Can I get them from Half Moon Bay?

Also what happens if my theoretical predictions are totally wrong?

Project unrelated: artisanal versus commercial: Waiting on some clarification of what strategy means

Project unrelated: backwards ESSs Waiting on some clarification of what ‘harvesting strategy’ means and what a biologically optimal harvesting strategy might depend on.

The idea is that you have two subsystems, linked by resource extraction. Want to know how the link between the subsystems change as drivers within either subsystem vary. 

In what ways would it be important for the link between the two systems to change?

Characteristics of model system
	•	Should be general, but applicable to fisheries:
	⁃	Common-pool resource
	⁃	Harvesters choose optimal extraction strategy 
	•	How does group extraction rate change as harvester strategy composition changes?
	⁃	Or how does the total extraction rate change as disturbances occur for a given composition of strategies?
	•	How might harvester strategy be composed?
	⁃	What are the evolutionarily stable harvesting strategies that exist 
	•	Are there classes of harvester behavior or natural systems that predispose to regime shifts?

	⁃	Fishermen &amp; Their Feelings: Implications for community ecology?
Thanks for coming all, today I’m going to talk about my proposed work looking at how harvesting behavior of fishermen affect the ecological dynamics of the fish they target. 
	•	Outline
	⁃	Background: first I’m going to give you some context and try to get you as motivated as I am by the topic of thinking about humans in a community ecology framework.  
	⁃	Human impact is everywhere: 
	⁃	Pollution (ex: garbage patch in ocean, size of texas?) —&gt; use seabirds filled with garbage (Chris Jordan photographer)
	⁃	Habitat destruction (ex: rainforest clearance due to agricultural expansion?)
	⁃	Invasive species (ex: zebra mussel in great lakes — evidence that their dispersal aided by boats, right? Simon’s on this paper)
	⁃	Climate change (which makes human impact pretty much global). 
	⁃	Harvesting of natural resources (bushmeat hunting, fisheries, timber production)
	⁃	Evidence for appreciation of humans global impact:
	⁃	Conservation increasingly thinking to include humans in their mission (TNC definitely, WWF? CI?)
	⁃	Businesses becoming aware: in the future ad, HSBC
	⁃	But from a community ecology, people’s effect on ecological system is also an interesting (if not sometimes a depressing) question
	⁃	Community ecology focused on examining groups of species co-occurring in the same place at the same time, and understanding their organization. 
	⁃	How do species affect one another 
	⁃	Structure of species interactions: food webs
	⁃	Diversity and stability debate
	⁃	Correspondingly, see more examples of ecology pivoting to consider human impacts on systems 
	⁃	Ghana trophic cascade, 
	⁃	Impact of humans removing top predators
	⁃	Not controversial to say that humans are shaping ecological communities 
	⁃	However there’s evidence that the ecology shapes humans harvesting behavior: 
	⁃	Brazilian fishermen, two very closely related communities harvesting different species have very different harvesting behavior. Suggests that the ecology of the two species had an important role in explaining the different harvesting behavior. 
	⁃	Admittedly this is a rare example, it’s hard to find things that seem so clear cut. 
	⁃	To summarize: it’s clear that humans impact ecological communities, it’s possible that ecology shapes harvesting behavior, and I’m interesting in understanding these feedbacks. And, lo and behold, I’m not the first person to have thought this up: Social-ecologial systems (SES) —&gt; introduce terminology: human and ecological sub-systems
	⁃	Evidence that considering human dynamics (specifically, change in behaviors) are important for understanding ecological system dynamics:
	⁃	Theoretical explorations: 
	⁃	Regime shifts: Tavoni et al. 2012, Lade et al. 2013
	⁃	Empirical
	⁃	Policy prescriptions: Smith et al.
	⁃	So at the most general level, I’m interested in understanding how humans affect ecological communities, but it’s not just a one-way effect. I am arguing that ecology also shapes harvesting behavior, and to understand human’s impacts, you need to take a step back. 

Transition (what have we learned?): Human behavior affects ecological system dynamics, and ecological system characteristics effect human harvesting patterns. 
	⁃	
	⁃	Questions: So I want to understand how human behavior is affected by system characteristics, in a general, mechanistic way and how those changes in harvesting patterns effect the ecological subsystem 
	⁃	Case study: fishing
	⁃	Fishing provides a straightforward case-study in which to examine this question. Have humans, fish, and the link between them: fishing. 
	⁃	And is interesting because…
	⁃	There are management surprises and collapses in intensively managed species
	⁃	Could be that there’s too much ecological uncertainty
	⁃	And, at least in fisheries, these management surprises have primarily been attributed to failures to study the ecology of the resource closely enough. This is apparent in the dramatic uptick in complexity and refinement in the fisheries literature. Those of you that have taken Simon’s theoretical ecology course are all familiar with the Gordan-Scheffer model on which the Maximum Sustainable Yield metric is derived from. To those uninitiated, it’s a model that assumes proportional harvest and a logistic growth recruitment function. From it you can determine the maximum growth rate that can be ‘sustainably’ harvested. Sustainable, in this case, referring to the fact that so long as you harvest this exact amount, the population should never go extinct. Whether or not you leave enough fish for seabirds or seals, that’s not included in these first models. However we’ve progressed quite a way, in the US at least, from the MSY models. Most fisheries in the US are managed now with some awareness of species interactions and there’s quite a push towards Ecosystem-Based-Mangement (EBM) where the harvested fish is one small part of a huge ecosystem. And you attempt to understand how fishing fits into this huge context.
	⁃	Also could be that we’re ignoring how humans respond to changes in ecology and management
	⁃	However the ecology is only one part of the equation that could be misrepresented. When you’re thinking about stock collapses, there’s the issue of how the ecology works, and what drives humans to make the decisions they do, and how humans will harvest the resource. These two systems can each be thought of a sub-system in a much larger system, a socio-ecological system. My contention is that the ecological subsystem has received a great deal of research, and while anthropology and economics have worked on the human subsystem, how the linkage between the two are affected by ecological and human drivers has received much less attention. It is this linkage, I think, that can help explain some of these management surprises.
	⁃	Evidence that human behavior matters (remember previously presented)
	⁃	Theoretical: Tavoni, Lade
	⁃	Empirical: Smith
	⁃	And indeed, Smith et al. (And Zhang’s other paper) are looking at one specific metric: effort (elasticity of harvest, I think). 
	⁃	Specifically, in US fishery stock assessments (research done by NOAA and NMFS to track the abundances of fish) the way the two sub-systems are linked is via a term called ‘effort.’ Effort is a nebulous term, but can be translated into variables like ‘days at sea’ or ‘time spent trawling’. It’s attempting to measure how much harvesting humans are doing. As you might imagine, there are some serious simplifying assumptions that go into these effort metrics.
	⁃	For one, effort is typically assumed to vary proportionally with stock abundance. 
	⁃	This has been discussed in the fisheries literature, but while can control for new technology and ecology, to some extent. Can’t control for fishermen’s strategy and information sharing. 
	⁃	So what’s left to do?
	⁃	General theory of optimal harvesting strategy: How do we expect humans to respond to different systems? And how does effort change depending on foraging strategy?
	⁃	Everything has been done piece-wise, case study by case study, what’s missing is generality (examples of case study-ness?)
	⁃	Goal: series of mathematical models (analytical and ABM) to explore how human behavior changes depending on 4 system characteristics:
	⁃	Ecology
	⁃	Gear
	⁃	Management
	⁃	Information
	⁃	Methods: How I’ll try to do that
	⁃	Analytical models and ABM
	⁃	Hypotheses: Specific hypotheses that I have about outcomes, alternative hypotheses
	⁃	Value of information: information that decays quickly requires information sharing among fishermen. 
	⁃	When information shared amongst fishermen, CPUE goes up even though stock levels remain the same. Irrespective of species ecology
	⁃	Very preliminary work
	⁃	Methods: The beginnings of an ABM, social foraging theory (shameless plug for my lab tea on May 19th!)
	⁃	Look at extremes of spectrum: no information sharing and information sharing for two extremes of ecology, uniform distribution and spatially patchy (no management or technology varying yet)
	⁃	Results: 
	⁃	Find that CPUE is much lower for information sharing than not. Much more work to do (what specifically) but…
	⁃	Implications of preliminary work
	⁃	Management uses CPUE as a proxy for harvest. CPUE going down naively indicates that stock is going up. Would be overly optimistic as a manager, even in an intensely managed fishery if this is most of the data you collect. 
	⁃	Next steps
	⁃	Analytical models!
	⁃	Social foraging theory!

            <Synopsis>Outline of questions, version previous to 2nd year talk</Synopsis>
            <Text>Support for the need of a general framework:
	•	Haynie &amp; Pfeiffer (2012) call for a general framework (and provide one) for how climate change is expected to effect fisheries systems. Say that characterizing the degree of uncertainty surrounding the various mechanisms and the range of possible variation in system characteristics is the first step to analyze different scenarios. 

Goal of this document
Outline the thesis, and have next steps for each section. I’ve listed the major questions and broadly how I’m going to go about answering them. Where possible I’ve listed a starting point.
Motivation
Interested in feedbacks between resource users and resource, how one can shape the other and vice-versa. As a case study I want to look at harvesting practices (defined here as where and when fishermen harvest). Hypothesize that harvesting practices arise from a combination of ecological, technological, managerial and social constraints, and the drive to maximize social standing and profit.
	•	Constraints here shape the landscape of the system. Examples of ecological constraints could be: how the fish move (magnitude of distances, variability in location), demographic events (salmon return at one time of the year to rivers, physical condition deteriorates as you move closer to the river); 
	•	Technological constraints are the size of boat you have, the gear that’s on it, whether or not you can harvest more than one species (generalist versus specialist). 
	•	Social constraints (i.e. information and norms). Demographic (experience) and information constrain your available actions. 
	•	Drivers are conditions individual fishermen are hoping to maximize: profit and social standing imme- diately come to mind. And they’re not necessarily synonymous with the other. 
Question 
Are there evolutionarily stable strategies in fishermen, and do those depend on the ecology, technology, gear and information available to actors? 
 Strategies 
 Specifically, in a fishing trip, fishers are faced with a series of basic questions. 
	1.	How does one search for fish most efficiently (given limits of available technology and management). 
	2.	After embarking on a search strategy, if you find a patch of fish, when should you stop looking for something better? 
	3.	When should I leave this patch of fish and start looking for another one? 
How do the answers to these questions (and hence strategies) change as system characteristics change? 

Plan 
Develop game-theoretic predictions for how ESS varies depending on ecology, management, gear and information. The fishing SES encompasses three levels of interaction: how fishermen interact with the environment, each other, and with management. I will consider these pairwise interactions one at a time. 
	1.	Start with interactions between fishermen and the environment 
	⁃	Starting point: Should be largely re-writing basic foraging theory results for fishermen. But still the payoffs for fishermen will likely be frequency-dependent even if information is not being shared. 
	⁃	Specifically looking at how different ecologies affect harvesting strategy – How spatially autocorrelated are the fish?
	⁃	How temporally autocorrelated are the fish? 
	⁃	How different assumptions on how fish are affected by fishing affect harvesting strategy → How different assumptions about cost and prices affects strategy
	2.	How gear type affects strategyAssuming one type of environment, how do interactions between fishermen change harvesting strategy 
	⁃	Starting point: Start with producer-scrounger theory probably
	⁃	Number of fishermen affect strategy
	⁃	Passive observation affect strategy
	⁃	Directed signaling affect strategy 
	⁃	Allowing punishment via withholding information affect strategy 
	3.	How do interactions between management and fishermen affect strategy 
	⁃	Input versus output control affect harvesting strategy
	⁃	ITQs versus TAC versus MPAs
	⁃	Policy applications? 
	⁃	Which are the sensitive parameters in determining the ESS for a given situation, and what are the set of parameters that can be effected by management, is there overlap?

	•	Seasons, sum over each season. Get inter-seasonal distribution for each individual

Most extreme situation: no spatial structure to fish, uniform distribution. 

Output after number of seasons: histogram of profit

When distribution of resources is uniform, everyone catches exactly the same amount, on incentive to change strategy (I.e. Share information)

Other end of spectrum: fish are patchy and mobile. So only a few people are going to catch some, but most people aren’t. So two peaks in histogram (high and low)

So now low catch people have an incentive to try to get information from high catch fishermen. 

But individually, even high catch fishermen have their own distribution. When does high catch fishermen have an incentive to change strategy. When fishermen’s distribution of catch over number of seasons is significantly lower than the fleet average.

	•	When any one of the four characteristics is changed. This is because I think human behavior is driven by these four characteristics. And when one of them changes, it should change human behavior. 
	•	Difference between changing human behavior and seeing change in biological status of fish. Could get a change in harvesting strategy that doesn’t change the level of harvesting impact on fish. Would need to watch metrics beyond ecological ones to know. Most interested in when it does make a difference. 
	•	Maybe could think of what the strategy would be when you have complete knowledge. And then how would things change as there was more uncertainty in the location of the fish?

There has been a great deal of work looking at how harvesting behavior may affect fishery dynamics. 
	•	These studies have focused on population level processes: 
	⁃	such as relaxing constant effort harvesting and exploring the possibilities of regime shifts by incorporating functional responses {Jones 1976}
	•	Or individual level processes
	⁃	Something

Some of this work is motivated primarily by understanding the ecology

Much work has been motivated by understanding the relationship between CPUE and stock abundance. Although these tend to fall in one of two categories: either focusing on how characteristics of the fishermen affect harvesting dynamics or how the characteristics of the targeted fish determine harvesting patterns. 
	•	Human side: 
	⁃	General theory for estimating stock size from search data {Mangel 1985a}
	•	Fish side: 

Occasionally studies consider both dimensions of the system. These come from the following modeling traditions:
	•	Predator-prey models
	⁃	{Allen 1986} 


What is missing is a general explanation of how individual foraging strategies will vary with characteristics of both the targeted fish and human harvesters and how this manifests as emergent population-level dynamics.

Foraging strategies of predators depend on the distribution of their prey, the 'catchability' of the prey, the handling time each successful catch requires to process, and the energy requirements of the predator. These individual-level characteristics combine into functional responses, population-level descriptions for how predation rate should vary with prey abundance. 

Fundamentally this is what CPUE is, how the catch (predation) rate of a fishermen should vary with fish (prey) abundance. It's a functional response for fishermen. 

Individual-level explanations have been proposed based on both fisher and fish characteristics. {Hilborn 1992} suggest that improved search efficiency and low handling times on the part of fishers will tend to promote a type II functional response, or hyperstability in the fisheries literature. Non-random spatial distributions of fish, on the other hand, will instead tend to hyperdepletion, where the predation rate falls much faster than actual abundance (there is no analogous functional response in the ecological literature for this case). 

How animals behave individually, including work on foraging theory, has provided insights for updating simplistic species interaction functions in predator prey models. However, as with fisheries models, foraging theory has not provided satisfactory theory to enable mechanistic explainations to scale from the individual-level to community level processes {Railsback 2013}. Thus using a fisheries system to better understand how harvesting strategy results from system level characteristics and emergent population level dynamics turns out to be a question of applied and fundamental interest in ecology. 

In order to characterize harvesting strategies, when and where fishermen distribute their effort, I will consider the intraseasonal dynamics of harvesting. Fishermen respond rapidly to changing ecological and informational conditions, and their harvesting strategies are emergent based on these millions of decisions as they aggregate throughout the year. 

The harvesting strategies themselves are a set of decision rules common to commercial fisheries. These decisions include patch residence times, 

Foraging theory is the main approach available for considering behavior at an individual scale. However this theory is constrained by the assumptions that it deals with only individual level behavior and does not make predictions.  


Similarly I propose that investigating what foraging theory predicts at an individual level, searching for evolutionarily stable harvesting strategies and how they vary with 

Foraging theory primarily deals with predators that consume huge numbers of behaviorally inert and sessile prey {Brown 1999}. 

Considering results from previous work in predator-prey systems which integrate the individual to the population level responses, Rosenzweig &amp; McArthur (1963) looked at predator prey systems in which the predators regulate the system by killing prey (N-regulated system) versus one in which the predators regulated the prey by scaring the prey away (µ-regulated system). Found that a catch-22 was present. Highly efficient predators resulted in intrinsically unstable populations (non-equilibrium fluctuations can lead to extinctions of one or both species) while ineffeicient predators gave rise to extrinsically unstable populations (external perturbations can easily cause predators to go extinct). However they found that behavioral responses on the part of both predators and prey could avoid this catch 22 and stablize the system.  

What's missing is an understanding of what types of systems should give rise to what type of search characteristics on the part of fishermen. Certainly the spatial distribution of fish is set by the ecological characteristics of the fish, but how these ecological characteristics interact with the gear fishermen use, the information they share, and the management in place, to result in efficient or inefficient search is not immediately clear. 

Foraging theory provides a mechanistic, individual-level framework in which to determine how system characteristics tend to promote particular foraging strategies. 

{Abrams 2010; Spalinger 1992; Abrams 1982; Brown 1999; Tschirhart 2012}



Specifically I will use this literature review to develop hypotheses about what the evolutionarily stable strategy for harvesting should be. 

The next step is to translate these strategies into functional responses. Such functional responses will allow the translation between individual behavior and population level dynamics. 

These relationships will be the starting hypotheses to test in an ABM, to see if strategies do indeed vary how they have been observed to in the literature. And how they can be related to functional responses.</Text>

Indeed, a recent meta analysis by Melnychuck et al. found that the biological condition of the west coast groundfish stalks were unaffected by the type of management in place. They concluded that as long as scientifically established quotas are set and enforced, particular management type is not important from a biological perspective.
(y axis is ratio of fish to fishing target, x axis is ratio actual biomass to biomass target, thus x,y=1 is a system that is meeting management goals).

Yet another paper by Smith et al. 2008 finds just the opposite. Here Smith et al. look at the gag fishery in the Gulf of Mexico. They compare two models: a biological model using age structure and the same model but coupled to a model of fishermen harvest behavior. The management policy in question was closing of the fishery during the peak spawning season of gag, where the big fish are most vulnerable to fishing.
￼Human behavior matters Seasonal Closure Management Goal
Protect vulnerable spawning fish
Raise the number of large fish in the population
Result
Number of trip days increase
Fishermen fish more during available spawning season Reduce number of large fish in the population
Smith et al. (2008)
Monday, April 8, 13
According to the biological model, this management policy reduced catch, increased the number of large fish in the population, and increased stock abundance. When you include harvesting behavior endogenously, however, the opposite is true. In the econometric model, fishermen are predicted to fish much more intensively in the remaining spawning season, and generally more throughout the year. So much so that the spawning season closure negates itself, and the stock equilibrates to a lower level then if there were no closure at all.
Thus there’s an unanswered question here, when does human behavior matter in fisheries?
This question is not new, however. CPUE is a metric that is both commonly used in stock assessments, and heavily depends on fishermen behavior.

But the problem is that it’s very case (and discipline)-specific. And that’s a problem in trying to make comparisons. Here are two well-studied examples, the Maine lobster fishery and the Pacific Tuna fishery. In categorizing different system characteristics, the differences are apparent. Lobster are sedentary, tuna are highly migratory. The management in place is at multiple levels in the lobster communities: you have lobster gangs at local level, with regional councils up to the federal government. The tuna fishery is very top down. There are international governing bodies to deal with the huge range tuna have, but in general quite top down. The gear that’s used is very different: traps versus (here) purse seines (big nets you draw around fish schools and scoop them all up (hence why dolphins can get in trouble). And the way information on fish location is shared is very different, in lobster fisheries information is very secret, and in tuna fisheries you can get the existence of a group of people that share information with each other.

search for evolutionarily stable harvesting strategies and how they vary with system characteristics
￼￼￼Monday, April 8, 13
how do links between the subsystems change (harvesting behavior) change as characteristics within either of the two subsystems are varied. These characteristics can be broadly classified into one of four categories: ecology (the spatial distribution of the fish, life history, physical habitat), management (whether there’s effort controls or total catch restrictions, whether ITQs are in place, or marine protected areas are present, in other words, what the temporal or spatial restrictions are), the gear the fishermen use, and in particular their fish finding technology, and the information they have access too (this could be personal information in the form of experience, present knowledge based on what they see around them on the water, observing other fishermen or directed information, when fishermen share information about their own experiences on where fish are.
There are 3 different scales to view this at: there is the interaction between the fishermen and their physical environment. There’s how fishermen iteract with each other, and how fishermen interact with management. So this helps to break down the scenarios and allows them to be comparable to one another.

I am going to punt a little bit here, I have a lab tea coming up in a couple of weeks where I’ll discuss modeling more in depth.
The idea is to do two types of modeling: analytical modeling using social foraging theory as starting point. This theory is useful because fishermen can be thought of as predators, but predators who’s payoffs depend on the strategies that other fishermen are using.
The second way is using agent-based modeling. Working with James Watson, we simulate fishermen fishing, making cost-benefit decisions on where they want to go and interacting with each other.
Ultimately in searching for evolutionarily stable harvesting strategies we want to know if we see signatures of them in real life. Working with James, Simon, and others on the CNH grant, will hopefully help understand empirical fishing records.
But I’ll go into this in more detail at lab tea in May!

￼Total catch
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Days at sea
Monday, April 8, 13
CPUE uses measures of fishermen effort like days at sea, and assumes that the amount of catch you get for a standard unit of effort (say one day) is proportional to the total abundance of fish in population. As you might imagine this depends on how a fishermen spends his day. And if all days aren’t uniform, then some catches may be more or less. In other words, change in CPUE could reflect either a change in the species abundance or a change in fishermen behavior.
Starting as early as 1984, there were rumblings that this assumption was unlikely to be true. And much effort has gone into standardizing the measure of effort for changes in gear (upgrades to technology) and the behavior of fishermen.
But as such, this has motivated work to understand fine scale behavior of fishermen. And from the other side, anthropologists have long been interested in fishermen communities, including how they harvest fish. Thus there is a sizeable literature about how fishermen interact with the marine environment.

            <Text>Introduction
The goal of this dissertation is to develop and test a framework that seeks to explain how fishermen harvest fish.  

There is a broad call to include human behavior in fisheries management and modeling, though not clear exactly how this will help fisheries management

Many case studies, but no general understanding of in what types of systems human behavior will be important in driving the entire system’s dynamics (and therefore important for management to consider)

Current state of fisheries management: system is treated as a density-dependent predator prey system with a mean-field assumption Marine fisheries are inherently a type of predator-prey system. Currently fisheries have been managed with mean-field approximations and density dependent relationship determined by stock models and harvesting rates assigned by managers. 

Much ecological work has gone towards examining in which predator/prey systems the mean-field assumption leads to mistaken predictions. 

Fisheries systems are one more example of a predator-prey system, but no one has considered the mean-field assumption in a general, comprehensive fashion. 

In predator-prey systems, mean field assumptions have been shown to be particularly erroneous when BLANK and BLANK are true about the system (just for example). In fisheries it is not hard to find examples of just such characteristics. 

Mean-field approximations of ecological processes are most likely to hold when the system is well mixed, organisms are highly mobile and organisms interact with each other over large distances {Law 2000}. Considering the oceans, a well mixed system with highly mobile organisms describes many fishery systems (herring comes to mind). However this assumption of a well mixed system and mobile species are not universal characteristics of all fishery systems. Indeed many fish species self assort by size, with reproductive dynamics that are also determined by the size of the individual. Such systems 

Because an abundance of work has found that these system characteristics are poorly approximated by mean-field assumptions, I expect that fishery management based on mean-field approximations in fishery systems that exhibit the same characteristics will also be poorly managed. In these systems fishermen fine scale spatial and temporal behavior will matter a great deal. 

Further, fishermen, unlike animals, are able to share information, manage themselves, and augment their predation efficiency (i.e. gear) in ways not common to other predators. Thus it makes sense to ask: how will these changing system characteristics interact with the ecology of the system to affect harvesting strategy, and therefore making fishing strategies more or less important to understand fishery dynamics as a whole.  

The goal of my thesis, therefore, is to do some number of things:
1. To 

My thesis will therefore be focused on answering the two related questions: how do system characteristics determine fishermen harvesting behavior?; and: under what conditions should fishermen behavior be expected to deviate from mean-field approximations and therefore be important for fishery dynamics?

These broad questions are further broken into a series of questions 

	1)	What different forms do fishermen’s harvesting strategy take?
	2)	How does the market structure (commercial versus artisanal) affect harvesting strategy?
	3)	Can optimal harvesting strategies be designed given system characteristics? Are first best solutions possible?
	4)	How does changing the harvesting strategy from exogenous to endogenous affect simple analytical models?

These questions will be addressed using four interrelated approaches
	1)	Analytical Modeling
	2)	Agent-based simulations
	3)	Empirical verification with catch logs
	4)	Developing a general framework for harvesting strategies in fishermen</Text>

NOAA uses hurricanes as an example of why human behavior matters. Prediction has dramatically improved in where and when hurricanes will hit, but aren’t able to save more lives, because people don’t listen to the warnings. So here human behavior matters.

            <Title>Intro_Motivations</Title>
            <Text>Introduction
Motivation: interested in feedbacks between resource users and resource, how one can shape the other and vice-versa. As a case study I want to look at harvesting practices (defined here as where and when fishermen harvest).
	•	Technological development, expansion of there world’s fishing fleets and subsequent over-fishing of many wild stocks have made the question of fishing effort the most pressing and difficult issue for fishery managers to deal with, and the social aspects of fishing effort have been relatively neglected in this area (@Gezelius:2007). The ability of a fisherman to turn his material assets into fish catch depends on his knowledge of how, when and where to use them most efficiently (@Gezelius:2007).
	•	In efforts to include more EBM in management, we need to understand at a finer scale how fishermen harvest resources. This subtly will allow management to be increasingly fine-tuned instead of broad-brush inflexible buearucratic dictates. We’re interested in characterizing how harvesting practices change (not just aggregate indicators) with different ecologies, management types, and technologies. We hypothesize that information transfer mediates these different drivers.
	•	Our goal is to understand and predict the feedbacks between ecological dynamics, fisher social behavior and management regulations in marine ecosystems. Fishing is an uncertain and competitive activity and a fishers behavior is highly sensitive to social, ecological and technological factors (@Hilborn:1985, @AllenMcGlade:1986, @Branchetal:2006). Fisher social-networks, target species dynamics, and gear (e.g. long-line versus trawl) all play a role in when, where and how much they fish (Fig. 1; @Wilen:1979, @Hilborn:1985, @Palmer:1991, @HilbornWalters:1992, @Charles:1995, @Wilenetal:2002, @SalarGaertner:2004, @Andersenetal:2010). Further, the way we manage fisheries also affects fisher behavior (@Hilborn:1985, @SalarGaertner:2004, @Branchetal:2006) and this we have exploited with incentive based institutions designed to control and predict the aggregate behavior of fishing fleets (@Costelloetal:2008, @Costelloetal:2010). However, the challenge for management remains to know which incentives to use given the circumstances. Improving our ability to do so will come from a more complete understanding of how fisher social behavior interacts with ecological, technological and management factors (Fig. 1).
	•	From @Branchetal:2006 : We manage people not fish, the study of people should be just as important as the study of fish. Also fleet dynamics, and individual behavior can help add nuance to CPUE, the most common metric of fish abundance. And a metric highly influenced by information transfer and fleet dynamics (@Branchetal:2006). CPUE also is much more what fishermen see than managers with research trawls. In order to understand discrepancies from the two, understanding harvest patterns provides a link between the two.
	•	One thought I’ve had quite a bit is that resource economics does a good job identifying when a tragedy of the commons is likely to occur, Ostrom’s work does a good job of identifying common characteristics of societies that have solved common’s governance. But there’s no theory to predict how different societies will transition from bad to good governance of the commons. (I’ve primarily getting this idea from reading the intro environmental studies text book.) For example, you can identify when a common pool resource is poorly governed, and maybe even which type of commons resources are most likely to be poorly governed. And Ostrom provides some guide to what works to allow sustainable use of common pool resources. But how to craft policy, which types of rules to use in which cases, that’s not explained by Ostrom’s work. And that transition to get from A → B is what everyone who wants to solve an environmental problem is after and/or confused about. Fisheries scientists/managers surprised by what happens when new rules go in, and the constant revision and brainstorming about new ways to solve the same types of conservation problems. So I guess what I’m thinking about is maybe there’s a more heuristic framework that could be devel- oped about how different types of communities are likely to respond to different rule implementations? But possible obstacles
	◦	It’s not that people can’t predict what will happen, it’s that they don’t. If resource economics were properly applied (just for example) many of the ‘surprises’ could have been predicted
	◦	The reason the same problems keep cropping up is because the common pool resource is embedded in a (or many more) much larger problem(s). Something like dictatorship, poverty, inequality/injustice that solving the common pool resource alone won’t solve. But solving those big problems would help solve the common pool resource (or make it easier to start solving the common pool resource problem).
Should see my ideas.tex file in Possibly_RelevantNotes folder. Lots of ideas, readings on the general motivation for this project. Think this is probably the most fleshed out part of the my proposal so far, can sit on it awhile. Other readings to consider: sustainability science section of Sente, all those general paeprs that call for ’more integration between social and biophysical sciences!"

As a first step in considering how incorporation of fishermen harvesting behavior can change ecological dynamics, I will analytically determine how changing a fisherman's functional response changes the dynamics of a fishery system. Here fishermen will have a type III functional response to fish rather than a linear one. Examining this harvesting equation graphically, the possibility of multiple stable states is immediately clear.

Here I propose to analyze a type III functional response and find MSY and compare it to the same system with a linear harvesting response. The functional response here is

            <Text>Project 1: Functional Response
Fisheries science is focused on undestanding and managing fisheries, and hence deals with the intersection of ecological and economic forces and dynamics. Starting with the Gordon-Schaefer model (1954?) there has been a tradition of modeling dynamics of fisheries effort and harvested fish stocks to make predictions for how these two forces play out. The Gordon-Schaefer model made clear predictions that an open access fishery could expect a tragedy of the commons to occur. 

Since this classic model, theoretical treatments of the dynamics of fisheries have become increasingly ecological and eocnomically sophisticated. Ecologically the Gordon-Schaefer model of a single uniform fish stock has given way to size- and age-structured fish populations, and then from single species to multipe species treatments {May 1979} to ecosystem-based management approaches. Developments in fisheries economics have relaxed the requirement of constant effort, constant price and costs, and others. 

However despite these advances, there remains a gap in the literature: in studies considering the dynamics of harvesting and the exploited fish, either there's great deal of detail about species interactions, while harvesting remains simplistic (ie this study) or human harvesitng behavior is more complex but the fish dynamics are ignored (ie Clark &amp; Mangel). 

Despite the considerable advances in sophistication and detail in these models, few studies consider how the ecology of the fish and the behavior of the fishermen jointly determine a fishery system's dynamics. The Schaefer model has not recieved the same treatment that many predator-prey systems have: incorporation of functional responses. </Text>

The problem is what I’m going to do and how I’m going to do it. The question that I’m arguing for is: under what conditions is human behavior likely to be important. 

And I don’t have a beginning hypothesis to start with, and without that I can’t come up with a test for how to disprove it. 

A starting one could be: 

When there is heterogeneity in the system, harvesting behavior is important to predict system dynamics. 

What I’m trying to get at is that if the system is uniform, there’s no spatial distribution of species that puts more of one type in one place than another, or an age structure where some fish are more important than other fish. Then you won’t see any ecological importance of harvesting behavior. 

Sidenote: Ray hilborn’s paper about fisheries production, does this discuss what different ways fish respond to harvesting? Can look for whether systems are heterogeneous or not?

But also when harvesters have flexibility about how to allocate effort, that’s important. But again, it’s only important if there are some sub-structures to the population. 

Lade et al. What characteristics of the study caused regime shifts?

Smith et al. 2008 Not what you’d expect because incentives changed?

Lot’s of talk about aligning fishermen and society’s incentives. How do you characterize someone’s incentive? Would imagine that it’s a functional relationship, as the variable you’re watching changes, your incentive to do x changes. And it could be a function of multiple variables. 

Therefore for an incentives to ‘align’ you need to have them both change in the same way. For example, incentive to go fishing increases as there are more fish. This is because the profits outweigh the costs. 

How do incentive structures affect SES dynamics? Are there types of incentive structures that lead to more or less stable SES dynamics?</Text>

            <Text>Expected Results
The results will likely be that fishermen having a type III functional response introduce multiple stable states into the dynamics, and thus by human harvesting allow the possibility of critical transitions that were not present when fishing did not occur. Further I expect that this transitions between one stable state and another will be governed by the parameter values describing the harvesitng pattern and growth rate of the stock. Considering how these parameters change the landscape of stability may provide some insights into the way that a change in system characteristics can lead a previously stable fishery to collapse without having to increase harvest rates.  This may be important to management IF fishermen do indeed exhibt a type III functional response.</Text>

That said, there are a number of case studies that look to determine fishermen's harvesting behavior over space, but none that consider feedbacks between the two subsystems. 

{Carpenter 1994} come closest, where they use a 33 year data set of anglers and fish (walleyes) in a Wisconsin freshwater lake. Found that fish had density-dependent dynamics but that harvesting by anglers followed a type III functional response. 

In particular {Lorenzen 2006} look at estimating Yield-Effort curves for multiple species on a reef. They come up with the idea that the Schaeffer model is not supported, and a sigmoidal response is. 

There has been a general treatment of under what conditions the linear response between abundance and CPUE is appropriate. However there has been no general analytic analysis of what a nonlinear CPUE (functional response) does to typical management reference points such as MSY or their stability. 

There is a number of instances of studies looking at optimal harvesting rates of interacting species, but no simple analytical studies that consider that the harvesting behavior itself may vary nonlinearly with fish abundance. </Text>
            <Comments>RUM models, need to run through my case studies to be sure. 
Should look up articles that cite it, think they're all empirical. Do look at what a dynamical model would be, but don't look at how you can get multiple stable states or compare to a typical shaefer model. This is a search through all papers on google scholar that cite {Carpenter 1994} and have the word "functional" in it. Should check to make sure no one else has done a theoretical treatment. 

Also see {Yodzis 1994} and {Lorenzen 2006}. Two papers that came up on web of science about fisheries and functional responses. 
But don't relate this back to the way fishermen are fishing. I think this has potential to explain. </Comments>

This project is phenomenological in approach and cannot consider what mechanisms may give rise to fishermen exhibiting such a functional response. In animal systems type III functional responses are typically attributed to prey switching or developing a search image, however it's not immediately obvious whether either mechanism may be found in fishermen in a fishery system. 

This leads my to my second project, which is, are fishermen likely to exhibit such nonlinear harvesting behavior such as a type III functional response. This leads me to ask what system characteristics determine harvesting strategies in space and time, and whether (and how) this be abstracted to a functional response.

            <Text>General Outline
Motivation: interested in feedbacks between resource users and resource, how one can shape the other and vice-versa. As a case study I want to look at harvesting practices (defined here as where and when fishermen harvest).
Idea: Hypothesize that harvesting practices arise from a combination of ecological, technological, managerial and social constraints, and the drive to maximize social standing and profit.
	•	Constraints here shape the landscape of the system. Examples of ecological constraints could be: how the fish move (magnitude of distances, variability in location), demographic events (salmon return at one time of the year to rivers, physical condition deteriorates as you move closer to the river);
	•	Technological constraints are the size of boat you have, the gear that’s on it, whether or not you can harvest more than one species (generalist versus specialist).
	◦	This is another major breakdown. Idea is that according to some recent food-web theory/pred prey dynamics, if you’re a generalist you’re able to surf on peaks of abundance of a bunch of different types of prey. But specialists’ dynamics are much more reflective of their prey. Hypothesis is that you could see the same thing in fishermen. Depending on price and costs (maybe in terms of abundance here and search time) you’d see ‘prey-switching’ of fishermen. Thus generalist fishermen would respond to changes in constraints and drivers differently than specialist fishermen.
	•	Social constraints (i.e. information and norms). Demographic (experience) and information constrain your available actions.
	•	Drivers are conditions individual fishermen are hoping to maximize: profit and social standing immediately come to mind. And they’re not necessarily synonymous with the other.
	•	I can’t be the first one to want to do this: what’s been done? Need to survey..
	◦	Fleet dynamics literature (and fishery biology generally?)
	◦	SES modeling literature
	◦	Fisheries anthropology literature
	◦	Economic literature…? (Econometric models for harvesting practices)
Structure of the Proposal
	•	Introduction (motivation and background)
	◦	Harvesting practices (as previously defined) scale up to provide emergent properties of the fisheries system. Decisions about where and when do fish result in variations in total catch and net profits, discards and bycatch.
	◦	Harvesting practices essentially a fast variable that scales up to affect slow variables such as the composition of fishery sector (entries and exits) or investments in gear.
	◦	Also lets more insight into CPUE which can be affected by constraints identified.
	◦	Should survey work on harvesting practices:
	▪	Are there spatially explicit analyses about where fishermen fish?
	▪	Which explanatory variables best explain patterns of harvesting (if any)?
	▪	Comparing and contrasting across ecological, management practices are there any signatures we can attribute to ecological or management only? Or gear only?
	◦	Common complaints (complaints that I need to address)
	▪	Why even bother trying to bring together social and ecological science? what’s the point?
	•	Section 1: Explaining the theory
	◦	Idea: Hypothesize that harvesting practices arise from a combination of ecological, technological, managerial and social constraints, and the drive to maximize social standing and profit.
	◦	Constraints: how do I theorize these constraints operate on fisheries
	▪	Ecology
	▪	Movement of species (daily, habitat preference, stochastic)
	▪	Phenology (salmon making runs back to rivers)
	▪	Weather in particular ocean [not sure if this should be here, since this isn’t related to the harvested species]
	▪	Theory to use: foraging theory
	▪	Gear (technology)
	▪	How big boat is
	▪	Fish finders, what not (mediates the ecology, I think)
	▪	Whether gear can catch more than one type of species of interest
	▪	Social
	▪	Information (socially derived information)
	▪	Social norms
	▪	Demographics (i.e. experience of captain, personally derived information)
	◦	Drivers
	▪	Profit
	▪	Social standing
	•	Section 2: Case Study
	◦	Review existing models of fishermen?
	◦	Use @Gezelius:2007 as a case study: can I turn this into anthropological study into a model?
	•	Doesn’t fit yet
	◦	Making sure drivers generate results that are robust to uncertainty (things that aren’t so fragile that if responses vary slightly whole outcomes changes)
Questions to answer
	1.	How to take the framework and put it into a model? This is not so much a question for my thesis to answer, but one that I need to figure out before my proposal is due. I think.
	2.	According to framework, if any of the constraints change, the harvesting practices should also change. This seems to be the biggest prediction to test.
	3.	Ecology: Fishermen are following prey, longer runs of fishing to locate prey and stay with good patches.
	4.	Technology: Single species versus multi-species?
	5.	Management: ITQs versus derby fishing the most obvious example. Can space out fishing trips throughout the year versus only when the fishing season is open for two weeks. This should affect information transfer.
How does information mediate these drivers?
	1.	Ecology: Information transfer is key in highly stochastic species (or maybe at some max level of stochasticity randomly choosing is as good as knowing), cost-benefits of sharing information. Costas are that you have to share with more, benefits are that you might get shared with more often if you share. Information less valuable the more people who know about it.

            <Text>Null models: pred-prey
Fisheries systems are inhernetly a predator-prey system, with humans playing the predator. Similar to Lotka and Volterra's predator-prey model, effort is assumed constant in the Gordon-Schaefer model, and hence is expected to vary linearly with prey abundance. This same assumption is found in the Lotka-Volterra predator prey model, and is  based on ideal-free-gas. To relax this assumption in predator-prey models, {Holling 1959} introduced the idea of functional responses. These functional responses can account for nonlinear interactions between predators and prey and have been used to account for mechanisms such as handling time, learning by predators and prey-switching. 

Indeed there is some work that draws connections between predator-prey modeling and fisheries systems. {Allen 1986} develop a set of models based on Lotka-Volterra predator-prey models, and indeed explicilty recognizes fishing as taking place within a complex system that is shaped both by biophysical and human dynamics. </Text>

            <Text>Random Thoughts
What about the trend for consolidation and increased removal from natural resource work.
Idea of ITQs being owned by rich people far away, gentrification of Maine harbors (@Hughes 2012), and constantly thinking of salmon fishers in Washington and Oregon. As these links to resource use get longer, does the fragility increase, is the system less adaptive?
What I told Scott Barrett was that I’m interested in what type of incentives do particular ecologies create. Basically thinking of it that you have an incentive structure that a management regime creates, and an incentive structure the ecology creates. What happens when you overlay the two. But then you have all these perturbations, in the form of new technology, a social environment and a changing physical environment that change the landscape. And your incentive is a function of all these things.
Can you look at management surprises that have happened in the past and explain things like hi-grading, poaching in MPAs, concentration of ITQs. If you can explain them, can you do the same analysis on current management and predict the results?
The pacific groundfish fishery depends in part on the California current and it’s productivity. So could examine how robust pro-social behavior is to endogenous and exogenous variation (due to physical and fishing, respectively). And how these two sources of variation affect management layered on top, jointly.
Fishermen behavior is important to think about, and people haven’t been! (Consider Hilborn 1985, 2007)
Theoretically, with the right incentive structure marine SESs should be able to be managed for ecological and economic sustainability. But we can’t because we don’t know about fishermen’s behavior. 
Could I look at how ostracism should arise? And what form it should take? 
One approach could be finding a harvesting strategy and then attempting to see if it’s optimal given the parameters of the system. 
Look up Pacific hake and sablefish? How are those fisheries parameterized? 
Pacific Hake: Stewart and Forrest 2011, Love 1996 --&gt; hypothesize collective harvesting; has three fishing sectors: 
	1.	a shoreside sector (deliver catch to shore for processing), ITQ
	2.	Mothership sector, catcher vessels deliver to motherships at sea, cooperatives
	3.	catcher/processor sector where vessesl at sea both catch hake and process them, single, voluntary coop
Sablefish: Love 1996, Schirripa 2007 --&gt; hypothesize individual harvesting, limited tradable quota system (limited entry fishery, with a finite number of permits and catch limits)
Examples of ABMs that have been used to understand the behavior and dynamics of fishers: Dreyfus-Leon and Kleiber 2001, Little et al. 2004, Milischer and Gascuel 2006
Questions for the mathematical/theoretical component
	1)	When is it more advantageous to work in groups
	2)	Does social history matter? Path dependence? What type of disturbances are cooperation sensitive to? Can management cause any of these disturbances?
	3)	How important is technology? Allowing improved fish finding, harvesting, or private signaling 
Models proposed to start with: 
	•	cultural evolution models: Richardson et al. 2003, Boyd and Richerson 2002, Bowles et al. 2003)
Intend to incorporate the resource abundance, technological parameters (detection and efficiency) and the regulatory environment (length of season). Should contribute to literature on the emergence of institutions as a result of interactions between individuals: Dekel et al. 2007, Lehman et al. 2008, Boyd et al. 2011 
Management and behavior: 
Weitzman 2002 showed that a landing fee (or tax) is always more efficient than an ITQ when the manager has to determine the TAC under uncertainty. The idea is that the landing fee allows fishers to determine optimal effort levels after observing the actual state of the stock, which he assumed they do with certainty. But which management is more efficient when fishermen have incomplete and private information?
So I have this idea that I could figure out the optimal way fishermen should harvest as you vary harvesting efficiency and conditional detection probability (given that fish school is there, what’s your probability of seeing it). Ecological parameters that would vary are what’s the probability of encountering fish, how many of them are there in an encounter (solitary? schooling?)
information would moderate encounter rate
technology would moderate detection probability and harvesting efficiency, and travel time.
idea is that as write equations that tell you your expected catch depends on
expected catch = (amount of patches/km2)(amount of fish in a patch - # fish/patch)(encounter rate - km-2)(detection probability)(harvesting efficiency) 
expected profit = (expected catch)(price) – (travel time)(costs)
basically is rewriting qEN from gordon-scheffer model. I’m sure Walters &amp; Hilborn 1992 discuss this. Should see what they say about it. Possible that people have already done this for different species. Although interesting to break it down into these terms. Because these are terms that can be more affected by technology and information that q and E can. But should see how q and E are calculated in Walters &amp; Hilborn 1992
I think the encounter rate is going to be a difficult thing to write down. Seems like it should depend on how autocorrelated the patches of fish are. And how constant they are from one year to the next. 
Okay, so you have some equation for expected catch and expected profit. Want to maximize expected profit. Or possibly have some minimum amount of money so that you don’t take a loss. 
I think you have to think of this over an entire season. Fishermen have some time τ during which they have to make at least π profit.
Big question is, how should you model the encounter rate for fish patches? 
Social foraging theory -- Food-sharing with communal costs (pg. 56) : think this would be applicable for understanding when, in a coop, is it good to share info with other fishermen in same coop about your harvest. 
Another thing is what outputs should come out of the ABM. 
	•	CPUE
	•	Total catch
	•	Variance
Okay, so motivation I think needs to be, how to evaluate management while considering fishermen behavior. But should really look through Van Putten et al. 2012, Fulton et al. 2011, Branch et al. 2006, Schulter et al. 2012, Lade et al. 2013, Horan et al. 2011 for reasons why the link between resources and resource users are important. Also the P. Abrams patch-harvesting model. 
After reading: goal to have a written summary of why one should care about links between resource users and resources. And ideally why marine SESs are the right place to look at it. 
If disparaged (likely) move on to reading about the SES framework. That might give me some ideas. But at least try to put the fishermen behavior stuff (plan part of my hypotheses) into that framework. Are there broader questions about SES that are interesting that are not related to fisheries harvests
Those are the goals for Monday. 
Also, does the ABM run?
How would I change things so that there is and is not a social network. What variables need to be saved to evaluate one run from the other? (Dreyfus-Leon 2006 might be a place to start).
Another thing to read could be EBM for oceans. 
An idea: When does local over-harvesting matter? To which type of fish? To which types of species that depend on the harvested fish? Alternatively, which types of harvesting are stabilizing, which types are destabilizing. What types of strategies end up having destabilizing effects on system, which are stabilizing?
Thinking that local over-harvesting is probably destabilizing. But that IFD harvesting (where profit is equal across all areas) is more stabilizing. 
So thinking are there information/gear/management that promotes local over-harvesting. 
Also thinking about Steve’s point that what would be interesting is how recreational and commercial fisheries compete. But also have different sectors of commercial fisheries. Which strategy should each take, and which one is better? How does that affect the underlying resource, themselves and their competitor?
Thinking of pacific hake with 3 different sectors. i bet each sector does not share information across sectors, and has different success. also has different impacts.
and depending on species dispersal abilities and reproductive rate, the impacts of local over-harvesting would be different. </Text>

Presupposes that such an incentive structure exists. 
Emma Fuller, 4/8/13 5:02 PM
patch is what i’m calling a group of fish. idea is that there could be few patches but large numbers of fish per patch, or many patches but only one fish per patch. 
Emma Fuller, 4/8/13 5:02 PM
I find myself thinking, who cares of fishermen do or don’t share information with others. Why should I care? My objective is to think how harvesting affects fish. so this is the first part of that, how do fishermen choose to share information. the second part is, what types of spatial harvesting patterns should most damage fish. 

What matters is when some perturbation shows up. If there’s a collapse in stock, randomly. And fishermen are not sharing information.. then the fishermen who was selfish doesn’t get any catch.. 

could be useful for making rules about how to share information in a coop. to make them sustainable and equitable across members. 

but thats not ecological. it does say something about what type of harvesting strategy is favored given an ecological resource type. and what management would have to do to make the system incentive information sharing. </Comments>

            <Text>Introduction/Overview
	•	There are several broad types of decisions that are traditionally considered when studying fishing-relevant decision-making. Short-term decisions are those that affect the way in which existing fishing capacity is used in practice and are generally of more interest to fisheries biologists, as the impact of the stock can be directly determined [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	These decisions include the temporal and geographical allocation of fishing effort, species targeting behavior, discarding and many of the compliance-related choices such as that of respecting catch-limitations, area or gear restrictions, or seasonal regulations – Hatcher et al. 2000 but found in [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].
	•	These short term decisions are distinguished from longer-term decisions that affect the level of fishing capacity and include investment, entry and exit, and technical innovation [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Strategic behavior that considers the potential decisions of others can influence both short- and longer-term decision making [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 

Economic explanations of fishermen behavior
Profit and utility maximization
Mainly an attempt to explain the behavior of an individual, not an individual as a member of a group. 
	•	Profit and utility maximization is the most common approach in the fisheries economic literature. It’s based on micro-economic theory, with the assumption that fishers can be considered as producers or firms. It’s assumed that individual firms attempt to maximize profit (revenue – costs) [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Argues that in the short term, certain input quantities and their associated costs, will be fixed and independent of the level and direction of activity of the firm [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Profit maximization implies that fishermen (or firms) make decisions that will maximize the difference between profits and costs. These choices will mostly be made my the captain and crew, but may be made on the level of fishing firms (mandating fishing tactics on vessels they own) [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Applications of profit and utility maximization approach predict potential outcomes assuming profit maximizing behavior, but don’t seek to explain observed patterns of fishing activity [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Micro-economic decisions are based on producer expectations of the revenues and costs associated with alternative production choices, which may each be characterized by different degrees of un-certainty. Thus empirical work seeking to explain observed patterns of choice have involved the development of models that try to explain how producers develop their expectations, and how these influence their choices. Many applications have relied on expected utility theory, and in particular discrete choice modeling [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 
	•	 Many based on random utility models (RUMs) that allow incorporation of both monetary and non-monetary attributes of choices, as well as the individual characteristics of decision-makers, including attitudes towards risk, variability in information levels, or the role of normative and social influences on decision-making [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 
	•	In RUMs, discrete fisher decisions, underpinned by expected utility maximization assumptions, can be statistically related to variables characterizing the attributers of the fisher, vessel and business, as well as of the alternatives [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 
Refs to follow up on — Profit and Utility Maximization
	•	The assumption of treating fishermen like firms has been shown to hold empirically for commercial fisheries – Robinson and Pascoe 1997 but found in [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]. 
	•	Some studies have found that the profit maximization framework may be more accurate in exploiting the collective (or average) behavior of firms that the behavior of individual fishermen – Holland 2008 but found in [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]. 
	•	Restricted profit functions have been estimated to determine optimal effort levels and targeting be- havior of individual vessels in the short term in response to input and output changes, as well as optimal levels of capital investment in the longer term – Squires 1987, 1998; Asche et al. 2007, 2008; Andersen et al. 2008 but found in [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]. 
	•	Cost functions have been used to estimate how average vessel size may change in the longer term under rights-based management systems – Asche et al. 2008 but found in [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]. 
	•	Random utility models have seen a growing number of applications in the last two decades – Bockstael and Opaluch 1983, Eales and Wilen 1986, Holland and Sutinen 1999, 2000; Curtis and Hicks 2000; Smith 2002; Wilen et al. 2002; Hutton et al. 2004; Pradhand and Leung 2004b; Marchal et al. 2009; Tidd et al. 2011 but found in [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]. 
Game Theory
	•	In a fisheries context, the focus has mainly been on the magnitude of a production unit’s inputs (effort required to maximize net individual benefits) within a game [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 
	•	Choices are assumed to be driven by rational and strategic behavior, where the interaction between rational and strategically behaving players is the game [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 
	•	Players can be individual fishers, fleets, regions or countries. Players’ decisions are not only bound by their own actions but also the actions of others targeting the same stock or fishing the same area. Players maximize their own well-being knowing that others maximize their own, which adds a level of complexity in the modeling of individual expectations and their influence on individual choices [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 
	•	The three types of games that have been applied to fisheries are defined as follows: non-cooperative games assume that each player maximizes self interest and can be used to study situations in which players compete for a resource; cooperative games assume that a group of players have agreed to maximize their common benefits and can be applied in cases where binding agreements between players are possible; in coalition games, both features of competition and binding agreement can be combined [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. The solution to these games is an equilibrium where players do not gain benefit from changing their behavior (i.e. the hours that they fish) unilaterally (the Nash equilibrium – Nash 1951, but in [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]).
	•	The game theory approach together with the fact that the main applications of game theory in fisheries has typically been in the context of two players (i.e. two nations) may be the underlying reason why earlier reviews of fleet dynamics models where the number of decision units is in tens or hundreds have largely ignored game theory [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. 
Refs to follow up on — Game Theory
	•	Game theory dates back to publications by Neumann von et al. 1947 and Nash 1951, 1953 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012]
	•	Munro 1979 provided one of the first applications of game theory to fisheries while game theory related discussion commenced at an earlier time with Davenport (1960) but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Reviews of the three applications of game theory in fisheries (cooperative, non-cooperative, and coali- tion games) – Sumaila 1999; Lindroos et al. 2007; Bailey et al. 2010 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].
	•	Non-cooperative game theory has been used to explain why overfishing can be rational – Clark 1980; Levhari and Mirman 1980 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Results from cooperation have often been contrasted with those from non-cooperation to show the benefits of cooperation – Sumaila 1997, 1999 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Non-cooperative and cooperative games also shed light on which management measures would enable stock recovery and whether it is worthwhile for parties to enter co-management relationships with government agencies – Hutton et al. 2011 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	A general finding of coalition games is that cooperation yields surplus. This surplus could be divided between players so that it would be beneficial for all players to cooperate – Arnason et al. 2000; Duarte et al. 2000; Lindroos and Kaitala 2000; Lindroos 2004; Kronbak and Lindroos 2007 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	In most cases, full cooperation cannot be achieved due to positive externalities and free riding, but partial cooperation can. Thus full cooperative management is rarely feasible – Yi 1997 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Game theoretic models can be incorporated in broader bio-economic models and/or give insight into RUM models – Haynie et al. 2009 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
Probabilistic explanations of human behavior
From [#Fultonetal:2011;]: Dealing with partial and probabilistic explanations of human behavior is a well-established norm in the social science and economics literature.

	•	Slovic et al. 1977
	•	Kahneman and Tversky 1979
Bioeconomic modeling in general, but fisheries in particular
	•	Bioeconomic fisheries models are inherently concerned with balancing biological and economic out- comes through the dynamics and consequences of human behavior...However recent applications have been overly simplistic and deterministic  [#Fultonetal:2011].
Anthropological approach
	•	There is a growing literature on fisher behavioral response in the context of management regulations. For instance there are some major strands of social research including descriptive reports of fisher behavior  [#Fultonetal:2011].
	•	Anthropological approaches tend to have less immediate application to fisheries biologists because they do not directly infer the impact of fishing activity on the stock  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].

	•	Early interest in fleet dynamics developed when it was realized that fishery-based data used for stock assessments could be strongly influenced by changes in the distribution of fishing effort and capacity, so that interpretation of changes in variables such as catch rates required knowledge and understand- ing of the associated changes in fishing behavior – Hilborn and Kennedy 1992, references therein, Gillis and Frank 2011, found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Quantitative models of fisher behavior and fishing fleets are available for a wide range of fisheries around the world – Vermard et al. 2008 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Potential benefits for fisheries management of improving our understanding of fleet behavior has been reviewed by Salas and Gaertner (2004), Fulton et al. (2010), Prezello et al. (2009) assessed recent advances in the domain of applied bio-economic modeling. But these reviews have not taken a systematic approach to assess the behavioral drivers that have typically been considered within fleet dynamic models and how these can be measured empirically  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].
Recent Reviews
	•	[#VanPuttenetal:2012;] review literature which attempts to explicitly model fleet dynamics, focusing on how effort over space and time is determined by within-fleet characteristics, rather than by external factors, typically management.  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;] find that while economic characteristics are often considered, it’s often by proxy rather than the data on the proposed economic driver. Further, social and social-pyschological factors are acknowledged to play an important role, but are rarely included in fishing fleet dynamic models.
	◦	Argues that more attention has been focused on stock assessments rather than the fishermen who are actually impacting the system.
	◦	Suggests that effective modeling of marine systems that will be useful to policy may not be achieved until the activities of the resource users are included and their drivers understood.
	◦	Fleet dynamics literature has developed over the past three decades
	◦	Defines fleet dynamics as “changes in both the fishing capacity of groups of vessels and in their fishing activity, including the intensity of their fishing effort, and its allocation across a range of alternative options in time and space. These choices results result from choices made by decision units often called ‘fishers.’ Fishers here can mean individual skippers all the way up to firms, producer collectives, sectors of a fishery, or nations, but from a fisheries biology perspective, typically it’s relating to the immediate and direct impact of fishing activity on a fish stock. Which means that decision units in a fisheries biology context are usually defined as groups of vessels that impose similar patterns of fishing mortality on target fish stocks.
Foraging Theory
Mainly an attempt to explain the behavior of an individual, not an individual as a member of a group.
	•	Foraging theory asserts that organisms behave in a manner that maximizes their energy intake at minimal energy outlay  [#vanPuttenetal:2012]
	•	Because foraging theory focuses on individual vessels, the theory is generally consistent with profit maximization. But also provides the foundation for the ideal free distribution (IFD), a theory that predicts the relationship between prey (fish) and predators (fishermen) in the environment  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	The use of foraging theory is applied more commonly from the perspectives of fisheries biology than fisheries economics. In fisheries biology, fishers are viewed as predators, whereas in fisheries eco- nomics, they are viewed as producers or firms  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Applications of foraging theory have focused on the prediction of fishing effort allocation in space. In an IFD, the assumption is that each fisher will go to the location they expect to maximize their profits, and thus their spatial movements reflect resource distribution  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].

	•	Foraging theory was first developed in behavioral ecology to describe the foraging behavior of organ- isms – MacArthur and Pianka 1966 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	In a fisheries context, fishing vessels may be viewed as individual foragers, aiming to optimize gain rates in the form of short-term net revenue at minimal cost – Gordon 1954; Hilborn and Kennedy 1992, but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Examples of using foraging theory and ideal free distributions: Gillis et al. 1993; Rijnsdorp et al. 2000; Abernethy et al. 2007 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	The equilibrium distribution (when assuming IFD) is where the proportion of foragers matches the proportion of resources present in that location – Gillis 2003 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Even under IDF, an equal distribution of the catch does not necessarily imply an equal distribution of profits. Despite the very simple human behavioral assumptions, the IFD approach provides a starting point for investigating short-term fleet behavior, by comparing the spatial distribution of resources and that of fishers – Gillis et al. 1993 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].
	•	Foraging theory provides a basis for the dynamic state variable modeling (DSVM) approach, which assumes that optimal fishing behavior can be calculated under the assumption that each individual is a utility maximizer – Poos et al. 2010b but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	InDSVM,thedecisionmakers‘state’includesanyinformationabouttheirconditionthatcaninfluence the expected rewards from each choice option. For fishers who choose to maximize profit, the state could include the catch of various speices in the hold, or the number of remaining trips, or amount of quota remaining – Gillis et al. 1995; Babcock and Pikitch 2000; Poos et al. 2010a but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].
	•	DVSM allows short-term choices to be reconciled against long-term constraints, such as where fishers face an annual quota but make daily decisions about fishing location, targeting and/or discarding – Poos et al. 2010a but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].
	•	Strengths of the DVSM approach include its ability to acknowledge opportunity cost (whether it is preferable to fish now or later) when applied to quota-based fisheries – Costello and Polasky 2008 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Another strength of DVSM is that in the context of estimating fishery response to new management regimes, its lack of dependence on historical patterns for its predictive power – Bue et al. 2008 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
Social Foraging Theory
Refs to follow up on  — Social foraging theory
	•	Gillis and Peterman (1998) have show that interference competition among fishing vessels may affect the distribution of fishers over their resources. While the underlying processes that lead to interference competition are not well understood, it is generally accepted that the efficiency of a vessel depends on the number and characteristics of its competitors. The implication is that the efficiency of a vessel is not only dependent on the characteristics of the vessel and fisher but also on the characteristics of the fleet as a whole – Rijnsdorp et al. 2008 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
Methodological approaches that don’t conform to any single conceptual category
Rule-based models of behavior — ABMS
Mainly an attempt to explain the behavior of an individual, not an individual as a member of a group.
	•	Conceptual approaches assume that all individuals operate in a generally consistent manner based on the set of incentives with which they are faced. However fishers do not all respond in a similar manner, as they are faced with different levels of information, different information-processing abilities and different constraints (social and/or economic). Instead their behavior may be described by a set of rules that are discontinuous in terms of the influence of particular drivers on decision making  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Theserulesmaybebasedonprofitmaximizationormayincludeanumberofotherdriversorbehavior responses. ABMs of fishing fleets simulate decisions and actions of individual agents based on a set of rules the may vary by individual  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	These ABMs typically consist of an environment in which the interactions between agents occur and set numbers of ageists each defined in terms of their behaviors (procedural rules) and characteristics (defined by a set of parameters). The characteristics and local circumstances of each individual are tracked through time, embracing individual variability  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].

Network Theory
	•	Network theory aims to explain the characteristics of a connected system and the behavior of con- nected individuals within that system. The connections between individuals in a network can be many things including, for instance, a friendship or a market exchange (e.g. buying and selling fish or licenses and/or quota). Information (and the sharing thereof) can also be considered a connection  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	The connections between actors in a network can be mapped and measured, allowing estimation of different statistical indicators that provide information about the network, the connections and the actors within it  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	It may be expected that trade networks, both in the product market and in the quota market, will also affect fisher decisions, in particular exit and entry decisions, but potentially also compliance decisions  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].

What we still don’t know
	•	 [#Fultonetal:2011;]: There are important methodological differences between quantitative bio- physical sciences and qualitative social sciences that further impede communication and generate a negative perception of the usefulness of information generated within other disciplinary paradigms.
Applications of theory
	•	Increased interest in fisher behavior coincided with a growing number of management changes that were implemented to address declining catch rates, with some of these changes aiming explicitly at modifying the behavior of individual fishermen and fishing firms  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Another reason underlying the increase in the number of publications since the early 1990s is the increased availability of desktop computers capable of carrying out more computer-intensive analyses. This is especially true in the case of spatially explicit bio-economic models (may of which rely on the predictions of location choice models)  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	 [#vanPuttenetal:2012;] review empirical work examining how fishermen’s behavior affects fleet dynamics. The find that almost 40% of the research has focused on location choice behavior, which (they say) is the central focus of many fleet dynamic models.
	•	 [#vanPuttenetal:2012;] also find that most (approximately 75%) of the work on fisher behavior has been applied to European and North American case studies, which (they say) probably reflects both the distribution of research capability in this domain and the fact the this domain of research originated from concerns over excess capacity in fisheries within these regions. They also find that most applications are to large-scale commercial fisheries.
	•	Most of the the applied research has focused on demerseal and pelagic species, and (especially in the location choice papers) has focused on trawl-based industries. This may be because much of the location choice analysis has been related to the impact of closures, and marine protected areas in par- ticular, to reduce the ecological impacts of trawl fisheries  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;] found that while a large proportion of studies of empirical fleet dynamics considered individual characteristics (including vessel attributes and/or descriptors of fishers and their motivations) as key drivers of observed choices, economic drivers tended to dominate. But only a very limited proportion of them actually included direct measures of profit per choice option except at the level of countries  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	However in most studies, various combinations of economic predictors were used to model choices, relating to factors that directly or indirectly determined profit, i.e. revenue, fish abundance, costs and working conditions  [#vanPuttenetal:2012]. However the actual variables used were often not direct measures of these drivers, but proxy variables  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].
	•	Inclusion of non-economic drivers of fishing behavior was fairly limited and focused mainly on group behavior, interference competition, habits and regulatory constraints  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].

	•	In terms of the literature on applied models of fleet dynamics, there was a peak from 2001-2005, with most of the papers published after 1995. This increase reflects a rise in the overall interest in the human component of fisheries beyond the work of fisheries economists (e.g. Wilen et al. 2002), as illustrated by Hilborn (1985) and later by Jentoft (1997) but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].

Location choice models
	•	Most of the location choice studies consider the vessel as the basic decision uint. Profit maximization is often used as a determinant of effect allocation and provided a basis for the identification of a set of variables with significant explanatory power in this respect. Overall, the variables most frequently used to explain location choices can be loosely grouped in a set of profit-related variables that either directly measure or serve as proxies for the short-term costs and revenues associated with alternative fishing options. In choice of fishing location, fishers will balance higher catch rates (affecting revenue) with costs. In many cases, the latter are mainly capture via proxy variables, such as distance to and from port and travel time associated with alternative fishing locations, rather than through direct measures. These, in turn, are often included as proxies for the influence of variable operating costs on trip-level profit – Eales and Wilen 1986; Dupont 1993; Holland and Sutinen 1999; Curtis and McConnell 2004; Hutton et al. 2004; Little et al. 2004; Pradhan and Leung 2004b; Smith 2005; Hicks and Schnier 2008; Valcic 2009; Venables et al. 2009 but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;].
	•	In many cases, observable vessel and business characteristics are used as scaling factors, as they will affect expected revenues and variable costs across different individuals in a fishery. For example, vessel size directly impacts on location choice behavior in that larger boats with greater engine power will be more expensive to run. On the other hand, they are more mobile and better equipped to fish during rough weather and can travel to more remote locations – Hilborn and Ledbetter 1985; Cabrera and Defeo 2001; Pradhan and Leung 2004b but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	Variability of fishing returns has been shown to have significant effects, in addition to actual or past catches, revenues or profit (Bockstael and Opaluch 1983; Dupont 1993; Holland and Sutinen 1999; Mistiaen and Strand 2000; Pradhan and Leung 2004b). Variability can be due to changes in the bio- physical resource characteristics, but can also be related to changes in demand and supply for fish products (Defeo and Castilla 1998; Smith and Wilen 1999; Cabrera and Defeo 2001) but found in  [#vanPuttenetal:2012;]
	•	The variability in catch is closely related to three other site-specific variables that the analysis of the literature revealed to be significant, including time of the year/week/ day, weather and physical characteristics of the areas fished  [#vanPuttenetal:2012].</Text>

            <Title>Project 2: Framework</Title>
            <Text>Project #2 Constructing a framework to generate predictions for what determines harvesting (foraging) strategy
To date there has been no general explanation for how harvesting strategy ought to vary depending on system charactersitics. There have been many case studies of how fishermen harvest in particular systems, but no work that has generalized these observations. In other predator-prey systems foraging predators search strategy, while subject to perhaps physical or evolutionary constraints, still has a foraging strategy that depends in some way on the ecological characteristics of its prey. 

Crucially, harvesting strategy will depend on both the movement and behavior of the fish and fishermen. Harvesting success is a destructive encounter (from the perspective of the fish) between fish and fishermen, and thus depends indirectly on how other fishermen in the same system encounter fish. 

I propse to do a thorough literature review of existing case studies to generate hypotheses for how fishing strategies have been observed (or hypothesized) to vary with different system charactersitics. While a basic first step, this is necessary to synthesize literature from a diverse conceptual (anthropology, fisheries economics, and fisheries science), and methodological (descriptive, empirical, theoretical, statisticsal) viewpoints. The goal of this literature review is to determine what evidence currently exists to suggest how harvesting strategies should vary with system characteristics. 

Given the heterogenous literature on the subject, I have constructed a general framework by which to classify these case studies in order to organize them in a way to make them comparable. Thus this literature review will generate a series of relationships between system variables hypothesized to be important and the way fishermen harvest fish. 

In both foraging theory and dynamic state variable modeling (DSVM), the decision of the individual depends on the current state of the individual, the state of the environment and what the next step will likely bring. These states of the individual fisherman and environment can be classified in four different dimensions for a fishery: ecology, technology, information, and management.

            <Title>Lotka-Volterra instead of logistic</Title>
            <Text>Fisheries systems resembles a Lotka-Volterra model of a predator prey system muchmore than it represents a logistic one. Fishing effort builds up as their is increasing profit available for fishermen (typically in the form of increased abundance of fish), fishermen are attracted to the fish stock until the fish stock is depleted, which in turn makes alternative sources of employment more desireable. Thus the key questions from this perspective are: how fast does fishing effort drop with declining returns on effort? How fast can fish stocks rebuild themselves? How fast does information about the size of the fish stock lead to an increase in fishing effort, an increase in information, and a repeat of the cycle? Considering the fishing system as inherently a predator-prey system brings fishermen into the system to be modelled, rather than assumed to be purely passive elements as is true in the logistic model assumptions {Allen 1986}. </Text>

            <Text>Summarizing what I have so far

The framework
There's 4 constraints and 2 drivers operating in a social-ecological system of fishing. Hypothesize that it's ecology, technology, management, and social drivers/information availability. 

ABM ideas/plans
The plan is to use ABM modeling and analytic approximations to explore how harvesting practices change with varying system constraints (ecology, technology, management, social drivers/information). The goal here is to explore how natural and social drivers interact. To break this big simulation thing down, first how the simulation will work

The Simulation
The simulation will be have a 2x2 grid that has fish and fishermen represented on it.
	•	Ecology: Fish are represented as a static field. 
	⁃	It will be governed by the logistic equation. 
	⁃	A parameter will govern how the carrying capacity ($K$) varies over space. This will make the fish more heterogenous. If $K$ varies not only spatially but temporally, this will simulate fish moving across the landscape. 
	⁃	This is technically a fishermen behavior, but the fishermen will have variable memory capacity. This means that if the carrying capacity is changing temporally, and the change happens quickly enough that the fishermen don't stay with the patch, then their memory will start to degrade the longer they spend trying to find it again. This is also true of when information is passed over long distances. What will happen in the model is that the fishermen forget where they're going on the way over there. But what we're trying to represent is the fact that after awhile that information is no longer very valuable. Especially for fish that are very mobile and stochastic (i.e. herring). 
	•	Information/social drivers: Fishermen will move across the landscape making decisions about where to fish. (Unresolved if they can also make decisions about when)
	⁃	The basic framework will be similar to Allison's migration model. Fishermen will have different sources of information to make a decision. Over time the fishermen will be able to change their preference for which source of information to preferentially use. The sources of information are
	⁃	Random movement (null source)
	⁃	Personal experience (where fishermen remember getting good catches regardless of how they found that catch)
	⁃	Local gradient tracking (according to technology parameter -- i.e. fish finders present or not -- can look around and see what they see)
	⁃	Passive observation (fishermen within zone of observation, if look like they've found fish, can go over there
	⁃	Socially directed information (a social network, not sure if static or will be allowed to change) where pairs signal to others when they've found fish. Ideally this will be dynamic so that if you're signaling to too many people, you'll reduce that number so that you balance between signaling and keeping it for yourself)
	•	Gear/technology: will be able to change. This governs what type of effort (a cost that's tracked, probably a combination of time it takes to pick up fish and process before you start fishing again, really a predator functional response) is required for a given quantity of fish. Will also affect your perception of local gradient and how much it costs you to travel different differences (some boats are small and fuel efficient, others are monsters and it's expensive for them to go far). 
	•	Management: Determines how much you're able to catch in total (TAC), or if you have a quota (ITQs), or there's spatial restrictions (MPAs). Could also experiment with management not often seen like port taxes and others that I can't think of at the moment. Also cooperatives where the fishermen share the total amount of fish they catch. 
It's not entirely clear how each will be put into the model. But the goal is that each constraint could be set to its end cases (absent, =0; completely present, =1). Also it would be ideal if the strategies of the fishermen could evolve in 2 ways. First is that they could choose what type of information to weight most highly, but if they choose the directed social information, that they can change their network connections. 
Another part of this is that there's the process of signaling to a clique-member, but there's also the process of someone asking you for information and whether or not you give them correct info. So there should be direct signaling. Some probability where you signal out to those in your network, and some probability that when you don't have fish, you send a “request” to random nodes in the network. And then if you get false information (you go somewhere and there wasn't any fish) then you reduce the weight you give that person's advice in the future while simultaneously making it less likely that you'll randomly form a connection between you and their node when you update. 
Which leads me to another form of the social network. If you're doing poorly with your social network, you flip some of the connections. Could either be random (where you just randomly drop and add other connections). Or it could be specific, you remember who gives you good information (where you end up finding fish more often than not) as opposed to those that give you bad information. This gets at the idea of ostracism. If you give good information, you're likely to have reliable partners. If not, then you're likely to be not invited to clique formation and end up on your own. 

What are the possible outputs of the model: the response variables?
	•	Total catch averaged over all fishermen (median, variance in catch between fishermen).
	•	Total costs (fuel, time spent catching, typical effort calculate in fisheries science).
	•	Total profit (total catch $-$ costs). Again average, median, variance.
Have not figured out about how to include biological feedbacks. Somewhat fraught issue about how fishing affects fish, and what EBM is all about. Understanding impacts. But perhaps could pull out some general hypotheses/scenarios and include those relationships in the simulation (how fish reproduction is a function of where and how fish are pulled out of the water. 

Some questions include
	•	When you allow different types of information to be present, do fishermen harvest differently?
	•	How does an ideal free distribution of fish affect fishing behavior. This is what happened in the NE Canadian cod collapse, catch went up before the collapse, but everyone was fishing in a tiny area. As density went down, more cod packed into high quality habitats. Which is where fishing concentrated. 
	•	ITQs: does varying initial distributions change distributions of strategies?
	•	How does the price change behavior. If fishermen have access to knowing about likely profit, how do they change their fishing behavior. Also something about some awareness of the end of the fishing season. The closer you get to the end, do you make take risks?
	•	Do particular types of fishermen go extinct? Fishermen with certain classes of gear? Certain strategies?

Things to keep in mind
	•	Need to do literature review to classify different subtypes, which are the main classes to vary the simulation over?
	•	Need to be sure that the constraints that I've identified are \textit{actually} independent. Because if I vary things as if they were independent and they're not, then that invalidates results. 
	•	At each stage that I have results, can I pare down the model to make it more simple? When two things seem to have a relationship. Can I preserve the basic qualitative nature of the relationship while reducing complexity of model?
	•	Be aware about chaotic blow-ups. Use understanding of sub-types of systems to control parameter values and functional forms. Think carefully about when I need to add non-linear relationships. And think that before I have to change structure or parametric values, that it might just need some critical damping. 
	•	Need to include some feedbacks on the fish. Should do a literature review of all the different ways fishing is expected to impact fish. Need to include these feedbacks if I want to examine sustainability of different types of fisheries.
	•	The point of generals is say: this is the best that's out there, and here's how I intend to do better.

            <Title>Sources to read and why</Title>
            <Text>The goal here is to start gathering sources that outline what theory has been done in fish SES systems, and what models already exist. In particular I’m trying to answer the questions
	1.	What are the questions these authors asked from their theory? 
	2.	What is the theory these papers used?
	3.	What does the model look like
I probably should read a bit more on the philosophy of modeling. I’m a little shaky on exactly the thought process that goes into making a model (why a model, do you have a question first? If you have a question about how things work, wouldn’t that just lead to empirical work to see if things work that way? What types of questions lead you to modeling?)
I’m starting by going through 3 recent papers: Fulton et al. (2011); van Putten et al. (2012); Gezelius (2007), two of which are reviews of models that incorporate fishermen’s behaviors and the third is an anthropological paper on the Norway blue whiting fishery that I’m interesting in trying to use as a case study as a transformation from anthro study to SES model.

            <Text>Project #3 Does including functional harvesting response explain unexplained fisheries collapse?
Given that there is theoretical evidence to suggest that harvesting strategy ought to affect the dynamics and stability of a fisheries system, even while holding harvesting pressure constant, this suggests that such unmarked shifts in parameter values leave some fisheries systems vulnerable to a shift in stable state. Here I propose to identify systems for which the mismatch between standard MSY calculations and MSY calculations with appropriate functional responses can lead to collapse and survey the literature to determine if this matches the pattern of collapses observed empirically. 

However these results will only be useful for management inasmuch as they are actually observed at an individual scale. Which leads my to my last project</Text>

James NSF wants to answer the following questions:

            <Text>What about the trend for consolidation and increased removal from natural resource work. Idea of ITQs being owned by rich people far away, gentrification of Maine harbors [#Huges:2012], and constantly thinking of salmon fishers in Washington and Oregon. As these links to resource use get longer, does the fragility increase, is the system less adaptive? 
What I told Scott Barrett was that I'm interested in what type of incentives do particular ecologies create. Basically thinking of it that you have an incentive structure that a management regime creates, and a incentive structure the ecology creates. What happens when you overlay the two. But then you have all these perturbations, in the form of new technology, a social environment and a changing physical environment that change the landscape. And your incentive is a function of all these things. 
Can you look at management surprises that have happened in the past and explain the?Things like higrading, poaching in MPAs, concentration of ITQs. If you can explain them, can you do the same analysis on current management and predict the results?
Now what I'm thinking is incorporating a simple stock recruitment function into the Tavoni et al. Paper [#Tavonietal:2012]. Fluctuating resources makes cooperators more successful, but when defectors get a double impact, both in getting more profit from more fish, but also deals a blow to everyone (by reducing the stock that everyone depends on), what happens? The idea is to explore how biology, and harvesting levels interact to shape fishermen's' incentives. Maybe using the model to look at pacific groundfish fishery. I think that's where VMS data and other data are coming from for James' grant. The goal would be, what are the key parameters that determine sustainable resource management. Instead of just focusing on enforcement to prevent defectors (people harvesting in MPAs, for example), can you tweak the system in other ways. Maybe by making everyone's yields more transparent so that it's easier to see who's cheating at the dock? Or maybe examining in what ways social capital is important for fishermen and trying to improve that. Also looking at how the structure of the stock matters in shaping these interactions. 
The pacific groundfish fishery depends in part on the California current and its productivity. So could examine how robust pro-social behavior is to endogenous and exogenous variation (due to physical and fishing, respectively). And how these two sources of variation affect management layered on top, jointly. </Text>

            <Title>Hypotheses</Title>
            <Text>Goal of this document
Outline the thesis, and have next steps for each section. I've listed the major questions and broadly how I'm going to go about answering them. Where possible I've listed a starting point. 

Motivation
Interested in feedbacks between resource users and resource, how one can shape the other and vice-versa. As a case study I want to look at harvesting practices (defined here as where and when fishermen harvest). Hypothesize that harvesting practices arise from a combination of ecological, technological, managerial and social constraints, and the drive to maximize social standing and profit.
	•	Constraints here shape the landscape of the system. Examples of ecological constraints could be: how the fish move (magnitude of distances, variability in location), demographic events (salmon return at one time of the year to rivers, physical condition deteriorates as you move closer to the river);
	•	Technological constraints are the size of boat you have, the gear that's on it, whether or not you can harvest more than one species (generalist versus specialist).
	•	Social constraints (i.e. information and norms). Demographic (experience) and information constrain your available actions.
	•	Drivers are conditions individual fishermen are hoping to maximize: profit and social standing immediately come to mind. And they're not necessarily synonymous with the other.

Question
Are there evolutionarily stable strategies in fishermen, and do those depend on the ecology, technology, gear and information available to actors?

Strategies
Specifically, in a fishing trip, fishers are faced with a series of basic questions. 
	1.	How does one search for fish most efficiently (given limits of available technology and management).
	2.	After embarking on a search strategy, if you find a patch of fish, when should you stop looking for something better? 
	3.	When should I leave this patch of fish and start looking for another one?
How do the answers to these questions (and hence strategies) change as system characteristics change?

Plan
Develop game-theoretic predictions for how ESS varies depending on ecology, management, gear and information. The fishing SES encompasses three levels of interaction: how fishermen interact with the environment, each other, and with management. I will consider these pairwise interactions one at a time. 
	1.	Start with interactions between fishermen and the environment
	⁃	Starting point: Should be largely re-writing basic foraging theory results for fishermen. But still the payoffs for fishermen will likely be frequency-dependent even if information is not being shared. 
	⁃	Specifically looking at how different ecologies affect harvesting strategy
	⁃	How spatially autocorrelated are the fish?
	⁃	How temporally autocorrelated are the fish?
	⁃	How different assumptions on how fish are affected by fishing affect harvesting strategy
	⁃	How different assumptions about cost and prices affects strategy
	⁃	How gear type affects strategy
	2.	Assuming one type of environment, how do interactions between fishermen change harvesting strategy
	⁃	Starting point: Start with producer-scrounger theory probably
	⁃	Number of fishermen affect strategy
	⁃	Passive observation affect strategy
	⁃	Directed signaling affect strategy
	⁃	Allowing punishment via withholding information affect strategy
	3.	How do interactions between management and fishermen affect strategy
	⁃	Input versus output control affect harvesting strategy
	⁃	ITQs versus TAC versus MPAs
	⁃	Policy applications? 
	4.	Which are the sensitive parameters in determining the ESS for a given situation, and what are the set of parameters that can be effected by management, is there overlap?
	5.	Doesn't fit yet
	⁃	How does calculation of abundance (whether assuming abundance is proportional to catch or via surveys) affect system as a whole?
	⁃	How do within season dynamics effect between season dynamics?

Methods
	•	Use analytical and/or toy models to explore each level of interaction
	•	Use ABM to further test strategies, confirm or disagree with simple models?
	•	Does this theory generate predictions that can be tested by data to which I have access (catch logs, VMS data, observer logs, etc.). If so, collaborate with James and NSF grant team on it. 
	⁃	What are the variances in catch success? Min/max ratio?

Challenges
I need to explain phenomena, rather than processes. I think what I have above is an example of processes. I think phenomena are questions like: what difference does having a fish finder make? Will artisnal and commercial fishermen have the same qualitative strategies? Or will it just be a scaling issue? Why do fish always collapse? Is it something about the composition of the fishery on top of it?
The phenomena that Steve got excited about was recreational versus commercial fisheries. Recreational fisheries take a substantial amount of the catch and have different rules applied to them than do commercial fishermen. So these are two populations that harvest the same resource but should have very different strategies. There should be some resource partitioning, and tradeoffs. Recreational fishermen should dominate close to the coast, because they don't need to maximize biomass intake. So can be happy at lower densities. Also don't have the gear to go out to George's Bank, for example. 
The other problem that Steve brought up is when, in the same fishery, will you get different fishermen following different strategies. And the answer is you probably won't. But between fisheries is where you'll see the differences. 
It all comes back to: what's the question I want to ask? What's the phenomena I want to explain? Examples in plants he gave me were: if you add more N plans make fewer roots, but water, they make more. Why? both are below ground resources. Or, if you grow two plants with a partition between them, they're fine. Take that partition away and they each make half as many seeds. Why? It's because they're fighting below ground and putting all their energy into that. 
Another thing I could do is a meta-analysis. Look at stock collapses and see if there are fishery characteristics (what gear type, how many people are in them?) that could explain collapses. Is there a phenomena where some stocks with some types of fisheries on top of them are far more likely to collapse than others? Why then?

Phenomena/So What?
The phenomena I'm interested is the unexpected failure of management. There's plenty of examples of the tragedy of the commons, where externalizing the costs but receiving the benefits leads to erosion of our natural resource base. But what I'm focused on are those circumstances when management is applied and things go wrong, but in a way that no one saw coming. Management here could mean policy changes, new recovery plans or regulations applying to how natural resources can be used. In fisheries science these situations are euphemistically called `management surprises.' Because I've been thinking about fishing as a case study, I have mostly fisheries case studies for you. Examples of these management surprises include restrictions on lengths of boats, that just increased dramatically in size.\footnote{But then what happened to the fishery? It would be convenient if it then collapsed because of inadequacies of the management} Another failure of management is the persistent collapse of fish stocks. 
And, at least in fisheries, these management surprises have primarily been attributed to failures to study the ecology of the resource closely enough. This is apparent in the dramatic uptick in complexity and refinement in the fisheries literature. Those of you that have taken Simon's theoretical ecology course are all familiar with the Gordan-Scheffer model on which the Maximum Sustainable Yield metric is derived from. To those uninitiated, it's a model that assumes proportional harvest and a logistic growth recruitment function. From it you can determine the maximum growth rate that can be `sustainably' harvested. Sustainable, in this case, referring to the fact that so long as you harvest this exact amount, the population should never go extinct. Whether or not you leave enough fish for seabirds or seals, that's not included in these first models. However we've progressed quite a way, in the US at least, from the MSY models. Most fisheries in the US are managed now with some awareness of species interactions and there's quite a push towards Ecosystem-Based-Mangement (EBM) where the harvested fish is one small part of a huge ecosystem. And you attempt to understand how fishing fits into this huge context. 
However the ecology is only one part of the equation that could be misrepresented. When you're thinking about stock collapses, there's the issue of how the ecology works, and what drives humans to make the decisions they do, and how humans will harvest the resource. These two systems can each be thought of a sub-system in a much larger system, a socio-ecological system. My contention is that the ecological subsystem has received a great deal of research, and while anthropology and economics have worked on the human subsystem, how the linkage between the two are affected by ecological and human drivers has received much less attention. It is this linkage, I think, that can help explain some of these management surprises. 
Specifically, in US fishery stock assessments (research done by NOAA and NMFS to track the abundances of fish) the way the two sub-systems are linked is via a term called `effort.' Effort is a nebulous term, but can be translated into variables like `days at sea' or `time spent trawling'. It's attempting to measure how much harvesting humans are doing. As you might imagine, there are some serious simplifying assumptions that go into these effort metrics. 
I'm assuming that the probability of a stock is nonrandom. And that some stocks are more likely to collapse than others because of a combination of how the effort is calculate in the fishery, and the actual harvesting strategy that fishermen employ. This rests on the assumption that 

	1.	The probability of a stock collapsing is nonrandom
	2.	That the effort metric is these stock assessments are fragile with respect to a particular type of perturbation (fluctuations in abundance, etc.). 
	3.	That, when analyzed, the theoretically optimal harvesting strategy would predict a very different response to perturbation than the assumption about effort used currently. 
Then the steps to seeing if this project is feasible/my intuition is based on anything are
	1.	Are the probabilities of stocks that have a US stock assessment collapsing non-randomly?
	⁃	Are some stocks more prone to collapsing than others? Is there autocorrelation? Either in region? Or by other fishery characteristic (gear type, demographics of fishermen, management regime?)
	⁃	What does a stock collapse mean in US stock assessments
	2.	That there are reasons to think that consideration of fishermen harvesting strategies is the missing piece to predicting fisheries collapse
	3.	That the effort assumptions used in stock assessments are fragile in some way
	⁃	How is effort calculated in US stock assessments?
	⁃	How are effort metrics incorporated into management rules?
	⁃	Are the way that effort metrics incorporated into management rules particularly sensitive to any mistakes? Or inappropriate assumptions? 
	⁃	If effort is incorporated into fisheries assessments in different ways, what types of fisheries have what types of effort metrics? And are these assumptions sensitive
	4.	And that the theoretically optimal harvesting strategy would respond differently. 

I'm here. First step is exploring how stock collapse is defined in US stock assessments and seeing if there's a non-random pattern of stock collapse. </Text>

            <Text>Project #4 Empirical Validation: Does harvesting strategy vary as expected based on theoretical predictions?
Here I propose to empirically verify my hypothesized optimal harvesting strategies using catch data from a number of possible sources. Because these (as of yet unknown) theoretical strategies are probablistic in nature, they should have statistical signatures in aggregate metrics. Things like total distance measured, total catch, variance in both those should provide some testable hypotheses to determine whether fishermen use these harvesting strategies.

In dynamic state variable modeling, the decision of the individual depends on the current state of the individual, the state of the enviornment and what the likely next step will bring.  These states of the individaul and changes over time can be classified in four different dimensions for a fishery: ecology, gear, information, and management. 

I hypothesize that harvesting practices arise from a combination of ecological, technological, managerial and social constraints, and the drive to maximize social standing and profit. Constraints here shape the landscape of the system. Examples of ecological constraints could be: how the fish move (magnitude of distances, variability in location), demographic events (salmon return at one time of the year to rivers, physical condition deteriorates as you move closer to the river); technological constraints are the size of boat you have, the gear that’s on it, whether or not you can harvest more than one species (generalist versus specialist). Informational constraints are based on a fishermen's experience and information available privately from other fishermen or publiclly through a management agency. Drivers are conditions individual fishermen are hoping to maximize: profit and social standing primarily, whichare not necessarily synonymous with the other.

            <Title>Heuristic framework</Title>
            <Text>One thought I've had quite a bit is that resource economics does a good job identifying when a tragedy of the commons is likely to occur, Ostrom's work does a good job of identifying common characteristics of societies that have solved common's governance. But there's no theory to predict how different societies will transition from bad to good governance of the commons. (I've primarily getting this idea from reading the intro environmental studies text book.)

For example, you can identify when a common pool resource is poorly governed, and maybe even which type of commons resources are most likely to be poorly governed. And Ostrom provides some guide to what works to allow sustainable use of common pool resources. But how to craft policy, which types of rules to use in which cases, that's not explained by Ostrom's work. And that transition to get from A to B is what everyone who wants to solve an environmental problem is after and/or confused about. Fisheries scientists/managers surprised by what happens when new rules go in, and the constant revision and brainstorming about new ways to solve the same types of conservation problems. 

So I guess what I'm thinking about is maybe there's a more heuristic framework that could be developed about how different types of communities are likely to respond to different rule implementations? But possible obstacles
	•	It's not that people can't predict what will happen, it's that they don't. If resource economics were properly applied (just for example) many of the `surprises' could have been predicted
	•	The reason the same problems keep cropping up is because the common pool resource is embedded in a (or many more) much larger problem(s). Something like dictatorship, poverty, inequality/injustice that solving the common pool resource alone won't solve. But solving those big problems would help solve the common pool resource (or make it easier to start solving the common pool resource problem). 

Not sure how applicable these are, or really where to go from here. Just some thoughts to have on paper.

            <Title>Disturbances</Title>
            <Text>Want to consider how strategies are optimal in relation to common disturbances. Simplest to think about is fluctuations in stock abundance. Malin is also interested in this. 

Thinking about Elinor Ostroms’ categories and resource and resource users that make for likely sustainable harvesting. One of which is that the resource flow is relatively predictable. In [#Tavonietal:2012;] they found that increasing the variability of the resource increased the region of parameter space that had a stable cooperator equilibrium.   Need to check that though  Although in their later paper [#Ladeetal:2012] they found that you could get critical transitions. Anyway, something worth revisiting as some theoretical work to look at how disturbances can affect social-ecological systems. Also possibly [#Horanetal:2011;] would be a useful paper to look at. Incorporates managers and resource users and looks at how the management would need to respond to move away from critical transitions. </Text>

            <Title>Distance from ecosystem services</Title>
            <Text>In terms of information required for good common pool resource management: if the availability of ecosystem services and the quality of the environment are not part of the understanding of the ecosystem services, it's more difficult for them to be managed sustainably. 
This is probably really similar to Ostrom's requirements: you need reliable information about the condition of the resource and how the ecosystem service depends on the condition of the environment

In efficient markets, the buyers and sellers recognize the approach of scarcity through prices, and they respond, sometimes by innovating in a way that actually drives down the price of a natural resource, at least in the short run. But goods and services not bought and sold in a market have no established price, and thus on of the important signaling mechanisms of scarcity or decline in quality is absent. And the incentive to innovate and to find alternatives may not be there either [#Leeetal:2012]. 

So thinking about it in relation to different types of fish. I guess how the information that fishermen and managers have confirm to Ostrom's information criteria might be important, or an axis worth looking into. 

But also thinking about more generally, the distance people are away from the natural resources they depend and the `weakness of feedbacks' makes sustainability more difficult... Not sure much more about this right now. But maybe something here. Externalities in efficient markets, weak feedbacks..</Text>

            <Title>General unsorted motivations</Title>
            <Text>From [#Ostrom:2009;]: The search for rules that improve the outcomes obtained in commons dilemmas is an incredibly complex task whether undertaken by users or by government officials. It involves a potentially infinite combination of specific rules that could be adopted in any effort to match the rules to the attributes of the resource system. Instead of assuming that designing rules that improve performance of common pool resources is a relatively simple analytical task, we need to understand that the institutional design process as involving an effort to tinker with a larger number of component parts. Policy changes are experiments based on more or less informed expectations about potential outcomes and the distribution of these outcomes for participants across time and space.

This was my rough thought. So how can I use existing policy changes as a way to understand underlying dynamics of SES. As in, a policy changes, what were the expectations of change to resource and resource users, did this happen, and why not?} 

This makes me think of Hilborn's recent paper that didn't find any particular combination of management rules as consistently successful. So it's not the exact rules that are in place, it's something both more broad that all the systems have in common. Probably some amorphous characteristics that all the systems share. This makes me wonder if there are types of biology or social-dynamics (i.e. information transfer) that characterize easier to manage SES, although this is also what Ostrom has already hypothesized/shown with much of her field work. What I'd like to be able to do is figure out which characteristics of Ostrom's framework are fulfilled in successfully managed v. not successfully managed commercial fisheries. And are there fisheries that don't (without intervention) match the framework but with management/added institutions and incentives now fit the predicted attributes of successfully managed CPRs? And then does this point towards how to implement management strategies in fisheries not currently managed well?

But this question/answer set up seems like: how to better manage systems, but not adding new knowledge of how a system works.. I guess I want to be able to look at feedbacks of SESs (and I keep saying that!).. So say I did classify fisheries as to how they fit into the Ostrom framework. Then imagine I get what I hypothesize to be true: that systems that more closely match her suggested successful attributes are better managed\footnote{ leaving this undefined for the moment}. Then what's the next step? How can you transform poorly managed fisheries into more successfully managed ones? Or how are changing resource dynamics expected to change the SES -- will that transform the system into a less ideal common-pool resource system? Or changing social dynamics?
