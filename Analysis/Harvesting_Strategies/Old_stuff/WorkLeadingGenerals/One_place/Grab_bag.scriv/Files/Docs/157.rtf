Fisheries systems resembles a Lotka-Volterra model of a predator prey system muchmore than it represents a logistic one. Fishing effort builds up as their is increasing profit available for fishermen (typically in the form of increased abundance of fish), fishermen are attracted to the fish stock until the fish stock is depleted, which in turn makes alternative sources of employment more desireable. Thus the key questions from this perspective are: how fast does fishing effort drop with declining returns on effort? How fast can fish stocks rebuild themselves? How fast does information about the size of the fish stock lead to an increase in fishing effort, an increase in information, and a repeat of the cycle? Considering the fishing system as inherently a predator-prey system brings fishermen into the system to be modelled, rather than assumed to be purely passive elements as is true in the logistic model assumptions \{Allen 1986\}. }
