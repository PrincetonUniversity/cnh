Received little empirical attention, adaptive foraging causes significant changes in functional responses and generates indirect interactions. Can affect co-existence of competitors, and top-down or bottom-up effects in food webs. Much work left to be done, including how to represent the dynamics of phenotypically plastic individuals in models, how flexible behaviors in multiple species interact, how adaptive movements occur in meta-communities and how adaptive behaviors affect evolutionary change.}

	notes = {() Steve Pacala prompted me to think about for what type of species would fine scale harvesting patterns matter. In particular, he suggested that species that are size structured (substantial ontogenic shift in habitat due to size), and tend to self-assort by size, ought to be more sensitive in numerical dynamics to fishing patterns.  
I have found a paper, \{Gaylord 2005\}, which looks at how size structure changes the yields that MPAs return to fisheries. In this paper they find that MPAs will increase fisheries yields most for species that experience density dependence after dispersal, and that have sedentary, long-lived adults.  
Gives some ideas for crucial components to include for ecology: - That all fish species have at least two distinct phases: larval (which includes dispersal) and fish 
Methods Here they use an integrodifference equation with Gaussian dispersal. They assume symmetric dispersal and that adults dont move from where they are dispersed to. Also assume Beverton-Holt/Ricker density dependence either before or after larvae are dispersed.  
They add two stages to the model in order to capture the fact that older, larger adults tend to build up inside reserves. This change means that larvae not only compete with each other, but also with already-resident adults. They also assume that older adults have twice the reproductive rate as newly dispersed individuals, trying to mimic the fact that big adults are more fecund. Also assume that older individuals weigh 1.5x that of newly dispersed individuals. Again to account for increased biomass inside reserves. Both adults and juveniles are assumed to have the same natural survival rate, and juveniles move into the adult class at rate gamma.  
Fishing is implemented either traditionally or with MPA reserves. Traditional fishing is some specified fraction of the individuals are fished out uniformly across all space. With MPAs there is some fraction of land set aside from which no fishing takes place, while fishing occurs without restriction everywhere else.  
Notes This means that they assume that theres no spatial structure to the fish population except that imposed by MPAs.  
Results Unsurprisingly, when pre-dispersal density dependence is present for a population that is not size structured, MPAs do worse than than traditional fishing in terms of fisheries yields. This is because the increase in fish density inside reserves reduces larval production.  
When size-structure is considered the MPAs effectiveness is amplified.  
Main conclusions MPAs should be extremely helpful for species that have post-dispersal density dependence, and adults whose fecundity increases with size and are sedentary.}

	abstract = {Theoretical ecology is largely founded on the principle of mass action, in which uncoordinated populations of predators and prey move in a random and well-mixed fashion across a featureless landscape. The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities. This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator-prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems},

	abstract = {Implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires a clear conceptual and quantitative framework for assessing how different harvest options can modify benefits to ecosystem and human beneficiaries. We address this social-ecological need for Pacific salmon fisheries, which are economically valuable but intercept much of the annual pulse of nutrient subsidies that salmon provide to terrestrial and aquatic food webs. We used grizzly bears, vectors of salmon nutrients and animals with densities strongly coupled to salmon abundance, as surrogates for "salmon ecosystem" function. Combining salmon biomass and stock-recruitment data with stable isotope analysis, we assess potential tradeoffs between fishery yields and bear population densities for six sockeye salmon stocks in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and British Columbia (BC), Canada. For the coastal stocks, we find that both bear densities and fishery yields would increase substantially if ecosystem allocations of salmon increase from currently applied lower to upper goals and beyond. This aligning of benefits comes at a potential cost, however, with the possibility of forgoing harvests in low productivity years. In contrast, we detect acute tradeoffs between bear densities and fishery yields in interior stocks within the Fraser River, BC, where biomass from other salmon species is low. There, increasing salmon allocations to ecosystems would benefit threatened bear populations at the cost of reduced long-term yields. To resolve this conflict, we propose an EBFM goal that values fisheries and bears (and by extension, the ecosystem) equally. At such targets, ecosystem benefits are unexpectedly large compared with losses in fishery yields. To explore other management options, we generate tradeoff curves that provide stock-specific accounting of the expected loss to fishers and gain to bears as more salmon escape the fishery. Our approach, modified to suit multiple scenarios, provides a generalizable method to resolve conflicts over shared resources in other systems}
