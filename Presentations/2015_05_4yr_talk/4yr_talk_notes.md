I'm really interested in people. A weird thing to be focused on in a EEB department right? But I really want to understand the impacts people have on natural systems, what mediates these effects, and how we can manage these impacts.

When we manage natural systems we rarely manage the systems themselves, but the ways in which people are allowed to make use of them.

Ecology has a strong history in this type of work. Conservation Biology and Restoration Ecology both characterize the impacts that people have in natural systems, and the ways in which we can return these ecological systems back to health. But this paradigm presupposes that given we can identify the _best_ strategy for protecting natural systems (either by identifying and preventing  the most dangerous impacts or by identifying and implementing the best restoration strategy) strong top-down management.

 Often, however, we are working in systems that have little to no management presence, or funds are so severely limited that the best options are not possible. Or simply that for ethical, economic, political  and/or pragmatic reasons, the people who make use of these systems cannot be excluded.  In these cases it's important to understand what controls and mediates the use poeple make of the natural systems and how ecological, economic and management characteristics mediate these impacts.

 [or people can't be completely managed in a top down manner. to make this a little more concrete, let me sketch out a modeling project that Eleanor, Malin and I just completed.

 We were interested in whether the effects of harvest and range shift were synergistic, additive or antagonistic.

 We developed an integro-differenc model, in which the main dynamics are that an individaul gives disperses and gives birth and is harvested. This is a very simple, analytically tractable model. We found that the effects were effectively addtiive. But then we added two commonly recommended management interventions: protected areas or harvesting rules. We found some counter-intuitive results. Specifically, that if you put in protected areas and harvesting pressure was displaced, that it mattered hugely where the harvesting pressure was reallocated. Essentially, having MPAs can make a population more vulnerable to collapse if people are reallocating their effort to the leading edge  of the population. Of course this makes a lot of sense once posed this way, but it does highligh the importance of human behavior here. Where people harvest makes a huge difference to outcomes. Understanding the sensitivity of management interventions to these types of human focused details is what I'm most ineterested in understanding and characterizing.

 I would say this broadly comes from better understanding the feedbacks between people, their environment and the ways in which they depend on and respond to ecosystem services.

 [alternatively]

 To make this a little less abstract of these feedbacks, I'll give a motivating example that originally galvanized me to apply to graduate school: that of the Olive baboons in Ghana as studied by Justin Brashares.

 In Ghana the large carnivores were exterminated due to obvious concerns about safety of people and livestock. Olive baboons, originally omnivorous, expanded their diet and shifted to become mostly carnivorous. Olive baboons have a prey profile that differs from large predators, where large predators tend to target prey species with relatively large bodies to make it worth their while. Olive baboons, however, took indiscriminantely from small to medium sized. So the size structure of prey changed dramatically, with likley concomitant effects on vegetation strcture.

 So here we have the classic economic effect pushing ecological change. But this change had anohter effect, the Olive baboons starting raiding crops. With crops at risk, families pulled their kids out of school to spend more time guarding the land. So this ecological shift causes a social/economic shift.

 The key point ot take from this trophic cascade/meso-predator release is that the cascade goves from economic to ecological and back to economic. Considering just one side of this cascade, whether it's ecological or economic misses the whole picture. And with it, perhaps missing the most effective ways to manage such a linked system.

 So suffice it to say, I'm interseted in people. I think there's utility to this, understanding the feedbacks between natural and human systems will provide us more effective methods of conservation and natural resource management, I think there's an ethical reason to do so, and from a basic science perspective, keeping people in the picture paints a more complete system of species interactions that I think is just fun.  

 But I'm not working in Africa, I'm working on commercial fisheries. I didn't come to Princeton with a background in these systems but rapidly got interested in them because of the following reasons. Principally because they are such a good case study of human-environmental interactions. Fishermen are affected by both the ecological system (the spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of fish they target) and markets (price, demand and supply for fish). Commercial fisheries are also important for the livelihoods of many people and are a major stressor to marine systems.

 In this talk I'm going to discuss work in progress which seeks to better link fishermen harvesting behavior and wellbeing to management, ecological and market conditions.

I'd also like to briefly mention two side projects I'm involved with in case it's interesting to others in the department.

I'm co-leading a SESYNC graduate student working group with Talia Young an ecology grad student at Rutgers and Brad Dubik a geographer at Duke to explore how commercial fishermen in the NE US are adapting (or not) to range shifts in commercial fish species.

I'm working with Matt Hayes at the University of Wyoming to develop a classification algorithm to determine when large ungulates (elk, moose, deer) are giving birth just using GPS collar data. Which has a number of very exciting and super interesting applications.

And finally I'd like to conclude with some very serious thanks. Specifically to Simon and my committee, but also to James Watson (now at the Stockholm Resilience Centre) and Jameal Samhouri (at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center). Also to Emily Klein, not to mention all the fishermen and managers that took time to talk with us in our work, my fellow fourth years, and all of your for listening to my talk.
