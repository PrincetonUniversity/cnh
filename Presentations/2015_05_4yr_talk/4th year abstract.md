Dynamics of a human dominated system

When we manage natural systems we rarely manage the systems themselves, but the ways in which people are allowed to make use of them. Conservation biology and restoration ecology both characterize the impacts that people have in natural systems, and the ways in which we can return these ecological systems back to health. But this paradigm presupposes that, given that we can identify the best strategy for protecting natural systems, there is strong top-down management to put the plan into action.

Often, however, we are working in systems that have little to no management presence, or the best options are not financially feasible. Or simply that for ethical, economic, political  and/or pragmatic reasons, the people who make use of these systems cannot be excluded from them. In these cases, in order to have a basic understanding of ecosystem dynamics and to develop management plans, we need a good understanding of what factors influence the use people make of the natural system and how ecological, economic and management characteristics mediate these impacts.

In this talk I'll present work attempting to develop methodologies to quantify the relationships between people and the ecosystem on which they depend using the commercial fisheries of the US west coast. I'll summarize future work and discuss sundry side projects.
