# Theoretical models

Seems like I need to know what sort of behavior I observe in the data before I can look at what implications that might have for search strategy and predation rates. But I also am not entirely sure what to look for in the data... But some ideas include

+ Territoriality (correlations in space)
+ Following (correlations in time)
